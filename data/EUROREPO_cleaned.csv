An unnamed ransomware actor encrypted data from the network of a Swiss farm,"An unnamed ransomware actor encrypted data from the network of a Swiss farm, the Luzerner Zeitung first reported on 5 August 2024.
According to the report, hackers encrypted Vital Bircher's farm's Windows network in Hagendorn near Zug and demanded 10,000 francs to decrypt it. The farmer refused to pay the ransom.
Due to the encryption of the Windows network, the farmer could no longer access the data from his milking robot, which was responsible for his 70 cows, and the milking robot could no longer feed data into the network. Due to this lack of data, the farmer was unable to recognise that a cow was pregnant and needed help, so the calf to be whelped died in the womb, and the mother cow subsequently had to be euthanised.

North Korean APT Group Andariel targeted South Korean construction and machinery companies in April 2024,"North Korean APT Group Andariel targeted South Korean construction and machinery companies in April 2024, according to a joint report from the South Korean National Cyber Security Centre, the National Intelligence Service, and others.
According to intelligence agencies, the campaign is twofold: on the one hand, Kimsuky has been targeting the websites of construction agencies with malware hidden in authentication services when a user logs into the website. This allowed Kimsuky to infect the computers of local governments, public institutions, and other construction companies in January 2024.
The joint campaign from Andariel started in April. The group exploited vulnerabilities in VPNs to install remote control malware into the systems of construction and machinery companies in South Korea. In this move, the hacker group is said to have succeeded in stealing machine and equipment-related blueprints.
The NCSC links the joint Kimsuky-Andariel campaign to North Korea's ""Local Development 20x10 Policy,"" meant to facilitate the building of modern industrial facilities in the DPRK.

According to the report, the cyber incident was discovered on 9 July 2024 on the websites of various healthcare providers, including the Clinico San Cecilio, the Virgen de las Nieves Hospital in Granada, and the Santa Ana de Motril Hospital. However, other healthcare providers from the Southern Health Management Area and the Granada district are also said to be affected. 
The cyber incident is said to have come to light when an attacker contacted the aforementioned healthcare providers, among others, and informed them that he had discovered a vulnerability that he would exploit if they did not pay him a ransom.

Ukraine's Military Intelligence Claims Responsibility for DDoS Attacks on Russian Banks on 23 July 2024,"On 23 July 2024, several Russian banks were hit with DDoS attacks, causing significant disruptions. The affected institutions included VTB, Russian Agricultural Bank, Raiffeisen, Alfa Bank, Post Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, and Rosbank. As a result of the attacks, mobile apps and websites were disrupted, causing clients to experience difficulties using the banks' online services and performing transactions via apps. The outages also reportedly impacted social networks, payment systems on public transport, and some airlines.
On 24 July 2024, Ukraine’s military intelligence (HUR) claimed responsibility for the DDoS campaign against the Russian banking sector.

Russia-linked UAC-0063 infiltrated a Ukrainian research institutions in July 2024,"According to the CERT-UA, UAC-0063, a Russia-linked threat actor (associated with APT28 of the General Directorate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, with medium confidence) hacked into the systems of an unnamed Ukrainian research institution on 8 July 2024 using HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY malware.
According to the report from CERT-UA, UAC-0063 gained access to the systems through a stolen email account, which allowed the actor(s) to launch a phishing campaign by masquerading as an employee; they sent a letter to recipients within the organisation, while a macro was embedded in the infected document. This enabled UAC-0063 to gain persistent access, which includes the possibility of remote control access.

Unknown Threat Actors Exploited Discrepancy In Liminal’s Interface To Steal $230 Million From WazirX Multisig Wallet On 14 July 2024,"On 14 July 2024, Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX suffered a major security breach involving one of its multi-signature wallets, resulting in the loss of over $230 million. WazirX noted that the affected wallet, operational since February 2023, used Liminal's digital asset custody and wallet infrastructure and had six signatories - five from WazirX and one from Liminal. The attackers exploited a discrepancy between the data shown on Liminal’s interface and the actual transaction contents, allowing them to replace the transaction payload and gain control of the wallet. Liminal stated that the compromised wallet was not under its custody. Despite robust security measures, including the Gnosis Safe multisig smart contract platform and a whitelisting policy, the breach occurred. WazirX halted withdrawals, launched recovery efforts, and is working with authorities and blockchain security firms. The incident was publicly announced on 18 July 2024.

Unknown attackers exploited vulnerability in the domain hosting service of SquareSpace to attack crypto platforms with DNS hijacking since 11 July 2024,"Unknown attackers were able to hijack the domains of crypto platform Compound Finance and DeFi protocol Pendle through the domain hosting service of US SaaS company SquareSpace since 11 July 2024.
Users accessing the websites of Compound Labs and Pendle were redirected to sophisticated phishing copies of the websites to extract their account information. 
Both sites issued warnings via their social media pages to stop visiting their sites until further notice. They advised users to change their passwords immediately if they had entered them on the websites.
Apart from the domains, none of the internal systems were affected by the attack. 
Both companies were able to restore their websites, but the investigations are still ongoing. SquareSpace has not yet commented on this situation. 

Later this month, the website of crypto trading platform dYdX v3 was also the victim of a DNS hijacking attack. On 23 July 2024, users were again redirected to a compromised version of the dYdX v3 website to steal their login credentials as was the case with Compound Finance and Pendle.

 RansomHub Ransomware Group Claims To Have Hit The US-American Pharmarcy Chain Rite Aid With Ransomware Beginning In June 2024,"In June 2024, Rite Aid, the third-largest drugstore chain in the United States, experienced a cyberattack by the RansomHub ransomware group, resulting in a significant data breach. This attack compromised over 10 GB of customer information, affecting around 45 million lines of personal data, including names, addresses, driving licence ID numbers, dates of birth, and Rite Aid rewards numbers. RansomHub claimed responsibility for the attack and posted details on BreachForums, including a screenshot of some of the allegedly stolen data as proof. Rite Aid, which employs over 45,000 staff across more than 1,700 stores in 16 states, detected the breach in June and has since restored its compromised systems with the help of external cybersecurity experts.

The LockBit ransomware group stole data and personal information of some customers from Evolve Bank & Trust,"The LockBit ransomware group stole data and personal information of some customers from Evolve Bank & Trust, the technology security company HackManac reported on social media on 23 June 2024.
The LockBit ransomware group first claimed to have hacked and stolen information from the Federal Reserve on 23 June 2024. This proved to be false when HackManac made the connection to Evolve Bank & Trust, and the bank admitted the incident the following day without referring to LockBit, but only to a cybercriminal organisation.
The stolen data included data and personal information of some Evolve retail bank customers and financial technology partners’ customers. The incident does not appear to have impacted banking customers’ debit cards and online and digital banking credentials. The attack compromised personal information of over 7.6 million individuals.
On 25 June, Affirm Holdings Inc. reported that its customer data could also be affected by the ransomware attack. Because the company [Affirm Holdings, Inc] shares the personal data of Affirm card users with Evolve to facilitate the issuance and management of Affirm cards, it is possible that the data of Affirm payment cardholders could also be exposed.

BlackSuit ransomware group paralyzed the system of South Africa’s National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) on 22 June 2024,"The South Africa’s National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) confirmed on Tuesday, 25 June 2024 that it was hit by a ransomware attack which is significantly affecting the dissemination of lab results. The attack began on Saturday, 22 June, when hackers deleted sections of their system, including backup servers. For the attack, an unidentified strain of ransomware was used, rendering parts of the agency’s IT systems inaccessible and blocking communication from databases to and from users. Officials have shut down certain systems to repair the damage, and an incident response team has been convened to address the attack. Preliminary results of an investigation have shown that databases holding patient information were not lost or compromised. The service’s laboratories continued to be functional and accepted further clinical samples. However, the disruptions delayed the processing of blood tests, leading to a temporary backlog of over 6.3 million samples. More urgent test results had to be communicated to doctors over the phone. This ransomware attack has caused alarm amid an outbreak of monkeypox in South Africa. NHLS, which provides primary diagnostic services for 80% of South Africa's population, expected to return to regular operations by mid-July. A self-identified middle-man called NHLS staff and a South African news outlet, urging the lab to enter into negotiations with the ransomware group BlackSuit, which he claimed was responsible for the disruption. The same individual threatened the release of one terabyte of not further specified data allegedly obtained from NHLS.

"Unknown Cybercriminals Encrypt Systems of Dutch communications company AddComm in Ransomware Attack Beginning on 5 May 2024, stealing data from Dutch Bank ABN AMRO and regional tax authority","Unknown threat actors launched a ransomware attack on the Dutch customer communications company AddComm, a supplier for ABN AMRO, as disclosed by the Dutch bank on 24 May 2024. The attack occurred between 5 May and 17 May 2024, with the security incident becoming firstly known to AddComm on 17 May 2024, when the systems were encrypted by the cybercriminals. The encryption of AddComm's systems and data, caused their systems to be unavailable to customers in recent days. The attackers potentially accessed data of a limited number of ABN AMRO clients. While no evidence currently suggests misuse of the compromised data, ABN AMRO is taking precautionary measures.
The attack did not affect ABN AMRO’s own systems, and the compromised data does not include sensitive information such as passwords or credentials that could be used for financial transactions. ABN AMRO has reported the incident to the Dutch Data Protection Authority and other regulatory bodies. 
By late May, reporting also indicated that the Regional Belasting Groep, also a Dutch regional governmental office responsible for municipal taxes and a client of AddComm, had data stolen through the ransomware attack between 5 and 17 May 2024. According to the RBG, the hackers gained access to its data through AddComm, which RBG uses to send out its tax assessments.

Unidentified threat actor executed ransomware attack on Puerto Nuevo Terminals Consortium beginning on 20 April 2024,"On 20 April 2024, an unidentified threat actor launched a ransomware attack on Puerto Nuevo Terminals, a major facility at the Port of San Juan, Puerto Rico, which is part of a consortium formed by Luis Ayala Colón and Puerto Rico Terminals. 
Puerto Rico Port Authority Director Joel Pizá Batiz pointed to increased traffic in the port area due to the incident at Puerto Nuevo Terminals. Despite ongoing efforts to restore normalcy, traffic on Kennedy Avenue in San Juan continues to be slow.
The ransomware attack caused temporary disruptions to terminal operations and posed challenges to operations. Despite this, Puerto Nuevo Terminals was able to maintain operations. General Manager Clarivette Díaz confirmed that there were no sensitive data breaches and that gate hours were extended to accommodate the increased truck traffic.
Federal authorities, including the FBI, initiated investigations into the incident, including its impact on interstate commerce.

"North Korean state-sponsored APT Andariel stole data from unnamed South Korean defence manufacturer through accessing maintenance/repair partner, starting in October 2022","As reported on 23 April 2024 by the South Korean National Police Agency, the North Korean APT, Andariel, infiltrated the systems of an unnamed South Korean defence company in October 2022, as part of a year-and-a-half-long coordinated espionage campaign alongside two other North Korean APTs, Lazarus and Kimsuky.
In the October 2022 breach, Andariel gained access to an employee's email account from an unnamed partner which maintains and repairs equipment from the aforementioned unnamed defence company. Through this, Andariel was able to steal data that was sent via email and was further able to install malware onto the defence company's computers, enabling the theft of more data directly from the defence company's servers.

To achieve the data theft, Kimsuky gained access to files sent via email to and from an unnamed defence company.

The Russian state-sponsored hacking group Sandworm attacked around 20 critical infrastructure facilities in Ukraine in March 2024 ,"Te Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) reported the detection of compromises by the Russian state-sponsored hacking group Sandworm (aka BlackEnergy, Seashell Blizzard, Voodoo Bear, and APT44) of around 20 critical infrastructure entities in Ukraine in March 2024. CERT-UA tracks the responsible operators as UAC-0133, which it identifies with high confidence as a subcluster of Sandowrm. More precisely, Sandworm conducted operations to disrupt information and communication systems at energy, water, and heating suppliers in 10 regions of Ukraine. In some cases, the hackers were able to infiltrate the targeted network by poisoning the supply chain to deliver compromised or vulnerable software, or through the software provider's ability to access the organization's systems for maintenance and technical support. The hackers also combined previously documented malware with new malicious tools (BIASBOAT and LOADGRIP for Linux) to obtain access and move laterally on the network. Between 7 and 15 March 2024 CERT-UA engaged in extensive remediation measures, which included informing affected enterprises, removing malware, and enhancing security measures. CERT-UA assessed that the targeting of industrial control systems at the heat, water, and energy utilities was intended to complement the effects of missile strikes on the same facilities planned for spring 2024.",2024,3,1,2024.0,3.0,15.0,authorities of victim state,[946],Hijacking with Misuse,[361],Not available,Critical infrastructure,Energy; Water,"[942, 60]","UAC-0133 < Sandworm/APT44/VOODOO Bear/Quedagh/TeleBots/FROZENBARENTS/IRON VIKING/Black Energy/Seashell Blizzard fka IRIDIUM/ELECTRUM/G0034 (GRU, Main Centre for Special Technologies (GTsST) Military Unit 74455)","Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested",1,19398,"Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites)",Political Actions/Statements,[973],Attribution by receiver government / state entity,Political Actions/Statements,[973],CERT-UA,Europe,"UAC-0133 < Sandworm/APT44/VOODOO Bear/Quedagh/TeleBots/FROZENBARENTS/IRON VIKING/Black Energy/Seashell Blizzard fka IRIDIUM/ELECTRUM/G0034 (GRU, Main Centre for Special Technologies (GTsST) Military Unit 74455)",,6,Asia,"Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested",Non-State Actors,[61],cert.gov,International power; Resources; System / ideology; Territory,"Resources and Territory, Power and Authority, Ideology and System",System/ideology; Territory; Resources; International power,Resources; Politics,"[91, 82]","Asia, Europe",Yes / HIIK intensity,2,HIIK 5,4,1,2024,4,19,State Actors: Preventive measures,Awareness raising,Awareness Raising,0,Europe,CERT-UA,No,0.0,Supply Chain Compromise,Supply Chain Compromise,3,Not available,Other/Unavailable,4,Not available,0,False,Not Available,2,Not available,1,"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",1,none,3,none,3,2,"Very high political importance (e.g., critical infrastructure, military) - intensity multiplied by 1.5",2,3.0,Not available,3,0.0,No system interference/disruption,3.0,No data breach/exfiltration or data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data,No data impact,3,1-10,0.0,1-10,0.0,Not available,0.0,euro,1.0,Not available,3,Human rights; Sovereignty,Conflict and Security Law; Humanitarian Law,"[564, 248]",Civic / political rights,Human Rights,2,Not available,2.0,0,2023,12,1,Not available,; ; ,Not available,Not available,Civic / political rights,Unfriendly acts/retorsions justified (missing state-attribution & breach ofinternational law OR state-attribution & missing breach of international law),3,bleepingcomputer,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,

"Chinese State-Affiliated Hacker Group Presumably Compromised 19,000 Confidential Files Of German Manufacturing Company Volkswagen Between 2010 And 2015","According to research by German public-service television broadcaster 'ZDF' and German news outlet 'Spiegel', Volkswagen AG was targeted in a cyber attack orchestrated by suspected Chinese state hackers between 2010 and 2015. During this timeframe, several attacks occurred, affecting not only Volkswagen but also its subsidiaries Audi and Bentley. It is estimated that approximately 19,000 confidential files were potentially stolen during these attacks. These files primarily contained information on drive technologies such as petrol engines, transmissions, and dual clutches, as well as future-oriented fields like electromobility and fuel cells.
Volkswagen confirmed the information regarding the cyber attacks but refrained from commenting on the attribution of the perpetrators. According to the research, the IP addresses associated with the hackers pointed to the Chinese military. Moreover, the utilization of espionage software such as ""PlugX"" and ""China Chopper"" further suggests the involvement of Chinese state hackers.
Volkswagen reportedly became aware of the attack on 3 June 2014, and responded by shutting down large parts of its network on 24 April 2015.

PAMI itself addressed the cyber incident the day after the attack in a public statement.
In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Rhysidia demanded 25 bitcoins, around $700,000, as a ransom. Around 20 August 2023, the ransomware gang Rhysidia exposed, that they had encrypted and stolen 831 GB of data. Though PAMI declared at the end of August, that they did not pay the ransom as the stolen information only contained a collection of working documents rather than sensitive data, cybersecurity experts discovered references to sensitive medial records, such as cancer care details, lap reports and vaccinations. The data also contains information on medical centre audits, patient billing, financial records, employee CVs and supplier contracts. In the beginning of April 2024 the ransomware group leaked the stolen data.

Nation-state backed attackers exploit zero-day in Palo Alto`s firewall against unknown targets since 26 March 2024,"Nation-state backed attackers have exploited a severe zero-day vulnerability in Palo Alto's firewall against unknown targets since 26 March 2024, according to researchers from Volexity. The CVE-2024-3400 vulnerability was designated with the maximum severity rating of 10.0 and was under active exploitation for at least two weeks. It enables attackers without authentication to execute malicious code with root privileges. Upon exploiting the flaw, the threat actor was observed creating a cronjob that would run every minute to access commands hosted on an external server that would execute via bash. Researchers at cybersecurity firm Veloxity believe that the  actors attempted to deploy a second Python-based backdoor, which they refer to as UPSTYLE, on the vulnerable devices. This UPSTYLE backdoor was hosted at hxxp://144.172.79[.]92/update.py, but Unit42 observed a similar backdoor hosted at nhdata.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws[.]com. The last modification happened on 7 April 2024, according to the HTTP headers. According to Palo Alto, it fixed the issue ""hotfix releases of PAN-OS 10.2.9-h1, PAN-OS 11.0.4-h1, PAN-OS 11.1.2-h3, and in all later PAN-OS versions"" shortly after the disclosure. Volexity believes that there have been at least six incidents with the first attack being on 26 March 2024. 
Volexity further stated that it cannot tie the attacks to a specific threat group, but given the resources required, and the organizations targeted, the intruders are ""highly capable"" and likely backed by a nation-state. However, Volexity identified one group, tracked as UTA0218, that is leveraging the vulnerability in ""limited attacks"". The company has warned that the vulnerability CVE-2024-3400 may be subject to mass exploitation as more groups become aware of it. This is similar to recent zero-day vulnerabilities that have affected products from companies such as Ivanti, Atlassian, Citrix, and Progress in recent months. Cyber security research team VulDB identified actors possibly associated with North Korean state-affiliated hacking group Lazarus involved in the attacks.

Threat Actors IntelBroker and Sanggiero claim responsibility for allegedly breaching Chinese online shopping platform PandaBuy stealing over 1.3 million records of customers,"As posted by cybersecurity researcher vx-underground on 1 April 2024, Chinese online shopping platform PandaBuy has been allegedly breached by threat actors calling themselves IntelBroker and Sanggiero.
According to an announcement on BreachForums, the threat actors claim to have stolen over 3 million customer records by exploiting several critical vulnerabilities in the platform’s API and accessing the internal service of the website. The data reportedly includes records of customers including UserId, name, phone numbers, emails, login IP, postal address and orders. The leak is considered to be legitimate, as third-party expert Troy Hunt reported that 1.3 million email addresses are considered valid, with the rest being duplicates.

"Unnamed hackers stole 8.8GB of data from Indian military, government, and energy sector in March 2024 ","According to a March 2024 report from EclecticIQ, various targets within the Indian Air Force, as well as government and private energy companies, were the victims of data theft as part of a phishing campaign in early 2024. The hackers used a modified version of the open-source information stealer HackBrowserData and likely utilised documents gained in a previous hack in January 2024, believed to have been perpetrated by the same actors, as lures by posing as officials of the Indian Air Force. This phishing campaign enabled the theft of 8.8GB worth of documents.

Unknown actors deployed StrelaStealer in two large-scale campaigns to obtain email credentials from various EU and US industries in 2023 and 2024,"Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks' threat intelligence division, on 22 March 2024 released findings from an investigation of two recent campaigns leveraging the StrelaStealer malware in autumn of 2023 and January 2024, which targeted email credentials across various industries. Since its emergence in 2022, StrelaStealer has been deployed in a series of large-scale exploitation attempts. Unit 42 observed peaks around 7 November 2023 and 29 January and 6 February 2024, with over 100 organisations impacted in the EU and US. Affected industries included technology, finance, professional and legal services, manufacturing, state government, energy, insurance, and construction. Unit 42 did not disclose the specific sector distribution for the 100 compromised organisations. Upon execution, the malware sends email credentials to a remote command-and-control (C2) server. 
Using spear-phishing emails containing malicious scripts as zipped attachments and adopting obfuscation techniques in the latest StrelaStealer iteration observed in January 2024, the treat actors behind the campaign continue to involve their tools with added emphasis on avoiding detection.

Sub-cluster of Russian APT Sandworm allegedly deployed AcidPour wiper against Ukrainian telecommunication providers since 13 March 2024,"According to a report by SentinelOne from 21 March 2024, a sub-cluster of the Russian GRU-led group Sandworm deployed a wiper against Ukrainian targets. Dubbed AcidPour, the malware is an updated version of AcidRain, which was used in a campaign against satellite broadband provider Viasat that targeted modems linked to the KA-SAT network and affected entities in Ukraine and beyond in 2022. The SentinelOne researchers stated that their observation coincided with reported disruptions at the four Ukrainian Internet service providers Triacom, Misto TV, Linktelecom, and KIM, which experienced connectivity outages since 13 March. Solntsepek, a group suspected to operate as a front of the Russian military intelligence service GRU, claimed responsibility for interfering with the telecommunication companies via Telegram on 13 March. CERT-UA tracks Solntsepek under the name UAC-0165. An official source at Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection identified UAC-0165 as a sub-cluster of Sandworm.

ShinyHunters allegedly obtained AT&T customer data between 2019 and 2021 leaking over 73 million records on 17 March 2024,"According to researchers of vx-underground, a data archive of 73 million records linked to US telecommunication company AT&T was leaked to the Breached hacking forum on 17 March 2024. Independent reviews by vx-underground and the privacy advocacy group RestorePrivacy could not immediately confirm whether the data originated directly from AT&T or a third-party compromise but verified the authenticity of the stolen data. The data contains AT&T customer information, including names, phone numbers, physical addresses, email addresses, social security numbers, and dates of birth.
A user by the pseudonym 'MajorNelson' offered the data for sale, claiming that the information was obtained from an unnamed AT&T division in 2021 by the hacking group ShinyHunters. In August 2021, ShinyHunters had advertised a cache with information of about 70 million AT&T customers, asking for $1 million for the entire database or $200,000 for access. 
First AT&T declared that the data did not appear to have come from its systems with respect to both the March 2024 and August 2021 attempts at selling the data. Then on 30 March 2024 AT&T acknowledged, with regard to the data leak on 2024, that customer information has been compromised and that the data stems from AT&T specific fields, yet it is still unclear whether it was a breach of AT&T or of one of its vendors. However, they say that the data set appears to be from 2019 or earlier, impacting approximately 7.6 million current AT&T account holders and approximately 65.4 million former account holders. According to the company the leaked data also contains passcodes of the current customers.
Though the company did not link the leak in 2024 to the yet-to-aknowledge-breach of AT&T by ShinyHunters in 2021, analyses of Bleeping Computer determine that both leaks contain the same information.
AT&T is facing multiple class action lawsuits after admitting to a massive data breach that exposed the sensitive information of 73 million current and former customers.

Hacker 'ph1ns' stole and released employee data from Acer Philippines obtained from third-party vendor in March 2024,"Acer Philippines, a subsidiary of the Taiwanese manufacturer of computer hardware and electronics, was affected by a data breach in March 2024. The breach involved the unauthorised access to employee data due to a compromise at a third-party vendor responsible for managing the company's employee attendance data. A sample of the stolen data containing employee data from Acer Philippines was subsequently distributed on a hacker forum by a user operating under the pseudonym 'ph1ns'.
In the post from 12 March 2024, the hacker made reference to #OpEDSA, a movement that is calling for political change in the Philippines and has been targeting companies in the country. Acer representatives confirmed the breach and stated that the compromised data hailed from a breach at one of their external suppliers in the Philippines. 
The threat actor asserted that the intrusion was aimed at data theft and denied financial motives. Ph1ns claimed to not have engaged in extortion attempts against Acer and provided evidence of data deletion on the targeted servers before their access was cut off.

IRGC front company Mahak Rayan Afraz targeted networks of US government organisations and high-value private companies beginning in or around 2016,"Operatives of Mahak Rayan Afraz (MRA), a front company suspected to be under the direction of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), gained access to networks of US government organisations and private companies, including defence contractors, from at least in or around 2016 to in or about April 2021, the US Department of Justice disclosed on 29 February 2024, when it unsealed an indictment against one of the operatives, Alireza Shafie Nasab, an Iranian national. According to the indictment, compromise attempts also were directed against unspecified targets in one other unnamed country.
In the US, the campaign extended to computer intrusions targeting the US Treasury and State Departments, the compromise of more than 200,000 employee accounts at an accounting firm and the targeting of more than 2,000 employee accounts at a hospitality company. Both companies are based in New York. In addition, from in or around February 2019 to in or around December 2019, Shafie Nasab and MRA affiliates targeted two defence contractors and a consulting firm. One of the defence sector firms, only identified as defence contractor-1 in the indictment, was compromised in August 2019. Access to an administrator email account at the firm enabled MRA conspirators to create accounts in the name of defence contractor-1, which the group leveraged in a spear phishing campaign against defence contractor-2 and the consulting firm. On 16 February, the State Department had announced a $10 million reward under its Rewards for Justice program for information on Shafie Nasab.
On 23 April 2024, the US Department of Justice expanded its indictment from February 2024 and charged Hossein Harooni, Reza Kazemifar, Komeil Baradaran Salmani, and Alireza Shafie Nasab. Hossein Harooni was responsible for procuring, administrating, and managing the online network infrastructure. In addition, he and Nasab falsely used the identity of a real person to register servers and email accounts. Reza Kazemifar was responsible for testing and developing the malware and the tools, such as spearphishing emails to the Hospitality Company-1. Kazemifar also worked for the Iranian Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defence Organisation (EWCD), which is part of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), from at least in or around 2014 trough at least in or around 2020. Salmani was also responsible for testing the tools and maintaining the infrastructure.

Blackout claims ransomware attack on French hospital in Armentières around 11 February 2024,"In the early morning of 11 February 2024, hackers sent several ransom notes to a French hospital in Armentières, stating that they had encrypted the hospital's data. Following the reception of the note, the hospital disconnected all computers from its network. Due to these response measures, the hospital was forced to close its emergency service for a day. The hospital said that the incident had no impact on  patient care at the hospital. 
On 9 February - two days before the attack was discovered - , newly emerged ransomware group Blackout published on their blog in the dark web that they had encrypted over 100 servers and stolen a database of 900,000+ patients with their addresses, phone numbers, medical history. The self-attribution is confirmed by cybersecurity experts such as Damien Bancal and Clément Domingo. As the countdown for paying the ransom expired Blackout published the stolen data on their website on 25 February 2024.

Unknown State Nexus Actor Gained Access to Systems of US IT Service Management Company Cloudflare in Mid-November 2023,"In November 2023, Cloudflare suffered a breach when its internal Atlassian server was compromised by threat actors leveraging credentials from a previous Okta breach.

Companies concerned included discount retail chain Rusta, the gardening retailer Granngården and building material supplier Moelven. Granngarden had to close its shops because of non-functioning checkout systems in its stores.

Unknown Hackers Exploited Vulnerability in Socket.Tech leading to Theft of $3.3 Million in Cryptocurrency on 16 January 2024 ,"On 16 January 2024, Socket.Tech, a major cross-chain infrastructure provider, was found to have a security vulnerability affecting multiple Web3 applications. The Bungee exchange, a key link between Ethereum and 12 other chains, became the target of unauthorised asset transfers that caused a loss of $3.3 million. The threat actor exploited a vulnerability in a newly added module of the Socket Aggregator system, compromising the integrity of the protocol.
A vulnerability in the mistakenly deployed module allowed the threat actor to steal funds from users who had given the Socket Gateway contract unlimited authorisation for tokens. The theft involved two malicious transactions using Ethereum. The tokens transferred included USDC, USDT, DAI, WETH, WBTC and MATIC.
In response to the incident, Socket.Tech disabled the compromised route and restored the protocol service after a six-hour interruption. The attack was limited to Ethereum, while applications on other chains remained unaffected. In total, according to a statement from Socket.Tech, 200 to 210 users were affected.

The threat actors put the focus for their phishing efforts on verified ""gold"" and ""grey"" ticked accounts.

The following accounts on X (formerly Twitter) have been taken over by unknown hackers: Personal accounts have been hijacked on 2 January 2024, such as the one of Brazilian politician Ubiratan Sanderson and Canadian senator Amina Gerba. The non-profit consortium ""The Green Grid"" fell victim to a similar intrusion the same day, falsely advertising for the LFG project. 

MalwareHunterTeam identified other notable compromises, including one affecting the account of cybersecurity company Mandiant on 3 January, a Google Cloud subsidiary, impersonating the Phantom crypto wallet linked to a cryptocurrency scam. The account of Web 3 security firm CertiK was also compromised to push a crypto drainer on 5 January 2024. One day later on 6 January 2023 US data service provider Netgear fell victim to a similar intrusion, of which the account was used to reply to BRCapp tweets. The X-account of Car manufacturer Hyundai MEA (Middle East & Africa) was also hijacked in the first week of January 2024, impersonating the cross-platform multiplayer RPG Overworld, which is linked to cryptocurrency firm Binance Labs. On 9 January 2024 the United States Securities and Exchange Commission fell victim to a similar compromise, having their account used for advertisements of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products, as posted by the victim.

US Mobile Network Operator Mint Mobile suffered Data Breach in 2023,"Mint Mobile, a US virtual mobile network operator that offers low-cost prepaid mobile phone plans, recently announced a significant data breach that exposed the personal data of its customers. The breach, which was discovered and resolved by the company, involved customer data - potentially enabling SIM swapping attacks. Mint Mobile had subsequently begun notifying affected customers on 22 December. Compromised data includes customer names, phone numbers, email addresses, SIM serial numbers, IMEI numbers (device identifiers) and brief descriptions of purchased service plans. Mint Mobile assured that no credit card numbers were exposed. The company also claims that passwords protected with ""strong encryption technology"" were not compromised, although it is not clear whether the attackers had access to the hashed passwords. While details about the origin of the breach have not yet been disclosed, a report from July 2023 indicated a threat actor had earlier attempted to sell data allegedly stolen from Mint Mobile. The data advertised in July had included partial credit card numbers, leaving it unclear whether the two incidents are related.

Self-styled Hacktivist Group Predatory Sparrow Hijacked Systems That Led to Nationwide Gas Pump Disruptions in Iran on 18 December 2023,"On 18 December 2023, the purported hacktivist group Gonjeshke Darande (Farsi for Predatory Sparrow) claimed responsibility for disrupting petrol stations across Iran, with Tehran being particularly affected. The attack was carried out in response to what the group perceives as aggression by the Iranian government and its proxies in the region. A statement by the group also directly addressed Iranian Supreme Leader Seyyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei.
Iranian Oil Minister Javad Owji said the attack had disrupted supplies to around 70 per cent of the country's petrol stations, but did not otherwise elaborate on the incident.
In a statement posted on social media, Gonjeshke Darande professed to have conducted the operation in a controlled manner to avoid harm to emergency services and civilians. The group claimed to have sent warnings to emergency services before the operation and declared to have deliberately left some petrol stations operational, even though they purportedly were able to completely disrupt their operations.
While Predatory Sparrow is not officially affiliated with Israel, the group is widely believed to have ties to Israeli security services. The group has previously carried out a number of operations against Iranian critical infrastructure systems.

Chinese APT Volt Typhoon compromised US critical infrastructure targets in 2022,"According to unnamed US officials and industry security officials cited by the Washington Post on 11 December 2023, the Chinese APT Volt Typhoon compromised several US infrastructure entities, including ""power and water utilities as well as communications and transportation systems"". The report links the activities of Volt Typhoon to China's People's Liberation Army. More specifically, the article mentions a water utility in Hawaii, a major West Coast port and at least one oil and gas pipeline as affected victims. There's currently no evidence that hacking attempts against two entities involved with operating Texas's power grid, the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, were successful in establishing access. Unnamed experts interviewed by the Washington Post further reported compromises of organisations outside the US, including electric utilities.
In line with findings related to the breaches of military infrastructure in Guam by Volt Typhoon, which Microsoft and government reporting detailed in May 2023, the observed activity reaffirmed concerns the threat actors may leverage the access to US infrastructure to carry out disruptive or potentially destructive cyberattacks in circumstances of escalating tensions between China and the US or its allies.

Polish train manufacturer Newag SA suspected of installing programming errors in its own trains since 2022,"On 5 December 2023, a trio of Polish security researchers (part of Dragon Sector, a Polish pentesting team) that were hired in May 2022 by Serwis Pojazdów Szynowych (SPS), an independent train maintenance firm, claimed that trains manufactured by Polish Newag SA have embedded software that disables them when their hardware is serviced by competitors. More specifically, the research collective found out that train systems locked up for no apparent reason after being serviced in third-party workshops. Dragon Sector speculated that Newag engineers introduced the code responsible for the malfunctions to ensure maintenance contracts would be awarded to Newag, in light of the apparent failure of competitors to complete the task. Prior to commissioning Dragon Sector for the review of the train systems, SPS had accrued 2 million złoty (€462,000) in fines for delays in fulfilling its contractual maintenance obligations.
Newag denied those allegations on the day following the presentation of these findings, stating that the technical issues are the result of the work of unknown hackers and threatened to file a lawsuit against Dragon Sector.
Janusz Cieszyński, Poland’s former minister of digital affairs, communicated on 6 December that Newag assured to him of no wrongdoing, but said that the report he saw indicated otherwise.

Chinese hacker group Chimera accessed IT system of Dutch semiconductor manufacturer NXP during 2017-2020,"The Chinese hacker group Chimera compromised user accounts of the Dutch semiconductor manufacturer NXP between 2017 and 2020, gaining access to the company's IT system and collecting information about the company's chip design and other intangible assets. 
According to the Dutch newspaper NRC, the threat actor used accounts belonging to NXP employees to log into the company's internal network. They obtained the necessary access data from previous data leaks in social networks such as LinkedIn. From the first infiltrated account, the members of the cyber gang are believed to have gradually expanded their access rights to cover their tracks and sneak into other supposedly secure parts of the networks. According to NRC, Chimera encrypted sensitive data identified by the group with ransomware and transferred it to cloud storage services such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive and Dropbox. Log files show that the cybercriminals returned in intervals of several weeks to access new data and take control over additional user accounts. 
In January 2020, NXP was informed about the intrusion by Transavia, a Dutch airline company that had been attacked by Chinese hackers in September 2019. The investigation into the breach at Transavia facilitated the detection of the NXP compromise. Based on reporting by NRC, the company did not consider it necessary to warn customers about the incident, as the manufacture of semiconductors requires specialised knowledge beyond the blueprint.",2017,1,1,,,,media (without further information on source),[239],Data theft; Hijacking with Misuse,"[824, 361]",NXP Semiconductor,Critical infrastructure,Critical Manufacturing,[432],Chimera,Unknown - not attributed,1,15183,"Attribution given, type unclear",Other/Unavailable,[449],Media-based attribution,Media Reports,[235],NRC newspaper,Europe,Chimera,,6,Asia,Unknown - not attributed,Unattributed,[164],heise,International power,Power and Authority,Unknown,Unknown,[106],"Asia, Europe",Unknown,1,HIIK 5,4,0,2023,1,26,Not available,Awareness raising,Awareness Raising,0,,Not available,No,0.0,Valid Accounts,Unauthorized Access,4,Data Exfiltration,Data-related Actions,2,Not available,0,False,Sensitive Info,3,Not available,1,"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",1,none,3,none,3,4,Moderate - high political importance,0,4.0,Low,0,7.0,No system interference/disruption,3.0,"Data corruption (deletion/altering) but no leaking of data, no data breach/exfiltration OR major data breach / exfiltration, but no data corruption and/or leaking of data",Data corruption or major breach,0,1-10,1.0,1-10,0.0,Not available,0.0,euro,1.0,None/Negligent,2,Cyber espionage; Due diligence; Sovereignty,Cyber and Technology Law; Conflict and Security Law; Due Diligence,"[688, 564, 772]",Non-state actors,Actors,0,Not available,2.0,0,2023,12,1,Not available,; ; ,Not available,Not available,Civic / political rights,Countermeasures under international law justified (state-atttribution & breach of international law),0,heise,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,
IRGC-linked hacker group Cyber Av3nger breached Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa in Pennsylvania on 25 November 2023,"The Iranian IRGC-associated hacking group Cyber Av3nger infiltrated the Municipal Water Authority in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, and took control of one of its booster stations on 25 November 2023. An image showing a message from the hacking group released by KDKA-TV suggests that the threat actors took over Unitronics programmable logic controller that manage pumps maintaining water pressure and regulating water flow. The intrusion had no impact on the facility's operations. The machine that was targeted uses a system called Unitronics, whose components are Israeli owned. Cyber Av3ngers announced via Telegram that they had targeted several SCADA systems in Israeli water plants, adding that ""any equipment 'Made in Israel' is Cyber Av3ngers legal target!"".
On 1 December 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD) disseminated a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) regarding the activities. 
On 2 February 2024, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury identified several IRGC-associated individuals as involved in the hacking of Unitronics PLCs.
Based on these findings, OFAC imposed sanctions on six members of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), also known as the IRGC Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization. Adopted under the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations and Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations, the measures extend to Hamid Reza Lashgarian, the head of the IRGC-CEC, alongside five senior IRGC-CEC offials.
One of the officials, Mohammad Bagher Shirinkar, had been previously designated in two instances on 18 November 2021 and 13 February 2019 for his role as manager of Emennet Pasargad and Net Peygard Samavat, two companies providing technological or material support to IRGC-CEC operations.

Unknown actor interfered with emergency signal network of health technology provider Tunstall Nederland in mid-November 2023,"An unknown actor targeted at Tunstall Nederland, the Dutch branch of a Swedish health technology provider specialising in long-term care solutions, on 12 November 2023. The infiltration resulted in a disruption of company systems involved in the relaying of reports from Tunstall's emergency buttons used by ill or injured patients or elderly customers to call for help after a fall. Distress signals sent from buttons did not reach Tunstall's control room, from where they are normally forwarded to emergency rooms. Envida, a welfare organisation, reported that over 3,000 patient buttons across Limburg, the Netherlands' southernmost province, were affected. Assessments of the nationwide impact were not immediately available. An internal investigation concluded that the threat actor was able to access data handled by Tunstall.

"French cloud computing service provider Shadow PC suffered theft of user data affectign 500,000 customers in late September 2023","A hacker under the pseudonym 'depressed' claimed to have accessed the database of French cloud computing service provider Shadow PC and stolen data from over 500,000 customers in late September 2023. The hacker advertised the information for sale on the underground market place Breach Forums on 11 October 2023, after Shadow PC had not responded to extortion demands. On the same day, Shadow PC reportedly sent out data breach notifications to affected customers. This notification, as confirmed by customers to Bleeping Computer, traced the intrusion of Shadow PC to an employee, who was tricked into downloading an information stealer from Discord at the end of September 2023. The hacker leveraged this access to steal an authentication cookie, which in turn was used to gain access to the management interface of a Shadow PC software-as-a-service provider. According to the breach notification, exfiltrated data included full names, email addresses, dates of birth, billing addresses and credit card expiry dates of customers.

DAIXIN Team claimed responsibility for ransomware attack on local service provider impacting five hospitals in Ontario on 23 October 2023,"The extortion group DAIXIN Team attacked the Canadian local service provider TransForm Shared Service Organization, indirectly affecting the delivery of patient care and the scheduling of appointments in five hospitals across the province of Ontario. DAIXIN claimed to have stolen a database tables dump of more than 5.6 million records containing personally identifiable information and protected health information, including 160 GB of sensitive documents. The group also reportedly destroyed backups and encrypted several thousand files.
The hospitals affected by the attack were the Windsor Regional Hospital, the Hotel Dieu Grace, the Erie Shores Healthcare, the Hospice of Windsor-Essex and the Chatham-Kent Health Alliance. The ransomware attack disrupted the hospitals’ access to Wi-Fi, email, and patient information systems. 
The hospitals addressed the incident in a joint statement on 23 October. TransForm is a not-for-profit, shared service organization managing the IT, supply chain and accounts of those hospitals. DAIXIN issued a ransom demand in the amount of $4 million, directed at TransForm on the following day. In reaction to a refusal by the affected parties to pay the ransom, DAIXIN began leaking parts of the data on their Tor leak site on 1 November, including information about patients, employees and administrative matters.

Threat actors RansomedVC and MajorNelsen claimed to have stolen data from Japanese electronics company Sony,"The two threat actors RansomedVC and MajorNelson claimed to have stolen data from the Japanese electronics company Sony, both groups announced at the end of September 2023.
On 28 September, RansomedVC published a post on their website declaring the group had succeeded in compromising Sony networks and put 260GB up for sale for $2.5 million. The group published an unusually small sample of files alleged obtained during the compromise (2MB). A second threat actor, MajorNelson, contested RansomedVC's claim in a post published on the hacker forum BreachForums on 26 September 2023 and disclosing a significantly larger pool of data (3.14GB) as proof of compromise. The 3.14GB cache contained details about the SonarQube platform, Sony certificates, Creators Cloud, incident response policies, a device emulator to generate licences. The title of the threat actor's post suggests the compromise may have occurred on 23 September.
Sony confirmed to Bleeping Computer on 4 October 2023 that it identified ""activity on a single server in Japan"", which is used for internal testing for the Entertainment, Technology and Services (ET&S) business.

Customer management support system of US identity service provider Okta breached in September 2023 ,"Okta, a provider of multifactor authentication and single-sign on solutions, confirmed a breach of its customer management support system that allowed an unknown threat actor to view files uploaded by customers. Using stolen credentials of an Okta employee, the threat actor was able to access sensitive customer data from so-called HTTP Archive (HAR) files that include cookies and session tokens. IT companies BeyondTrust and Cloudflare, customers of Okta, acknowledged in separate reports that their systems were targeted with this information obtained through session hijacking. BeyondTrust alleged moreover that they reported the issue two weeks prior to Okta's confirmation on 20 October 2023. After initially suggesting that only 1% of customers had been affected, Okta confirmed on 29 November that all customer support users had been impacted - primarily in terms of their name and email address.
On 1 February Cloudflare disclosed, that its internal Atlassian server was breached by a suspected 'nation state attacker' who accessed its Confluence wiki, Jira bug database, and Bitbucket source code management system. The first access was gained on 14 November 2023 by using the stolen tokens during the Okta breach in September 2023.
On 9 March ""Ddarknotevil"" claimed to publish an Okta Database with information of 3,800 customers.

Eastern European defense and energy companies targeted with MATA malware from August 2022 until May 2023,"Over a dozen Eastern European defense and oil and gas companies were targeted in a campaign beginning in mid-August 2022 and ending in May 2023 according to a report by cybersecurity company Kaspersky. The attackers used spear-phishing messages to infect the victims with malware from the MATA cluster. After obtaining initial access, the attackers tried to steadily expand the infection and establish lasting access to the companies' internal systems. The campaign involved three new generations of MATA malware. The MATA family has been associated with the North Korean threat actor Lazarus. Observing elements in the latest MATA iteration that had previously been linked to Five Eye actors, such as Lamberts and the Equation group, Kaspersky refrained from linking the activity to one specific actor, noting only that the developer likely is ""familiar with Korean or uses a Korean work environment"" and had sufficient resources to leverage three expansive attack frameworks in one campaign.",2022,8,1,,,,IT-security company,[322],Hijacking without Misuse,[367],Not available,Critical infrastructure,Defence industry; Energy,"[404, 942]",Not available,Not available,1,15402,Not available,Other/Unavailable,[449],Not available,Other/Unavailable,[449],Not available,,Not available,Miscellaneous,2,,Not available,Miscellaneous,[39],dragos,International power,Power and Authority,Unknown,Unknown,[106],"Asia, Europe",Unknown,1,HIIK 5,4,0,2023,1,26,Not available,Awareness raising,Awareness Raising,0,,Not available,No,0.0,Phishing,Deception and Manipulation,1,Not available,Other/Unavailable,4,Required,1,False,Not Available,2,Not available,1,"Hijacking, not used - empowerment (incident scores 1 point in intensity)",0,none,3,none,3,1,Moderate - high political importance,0,1.0,Low,0,6.0,No system interference/disruption,3.0,No data breach/exfiltration or data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data,No data impact,3,11-50,0.0,1-10,0.0,Not available,0.0,euro,1.0,Not available,3,Sovereignty,Conflict and Security Law,[564],Civic / political rights,Human Rights,2,Not available,2.0,0,2023,12,1,Not available,; ; ,Not available,Not available,Civic / political rights,Unfriendly acts/retorsions justified (missing state-attribution & breach ofinternational law OR state-attribution & missing breach of international law),3,therecord.media,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,

They mainly used Trojanised Virtual Networking Clients (VNCs), through which a computer is compromised after the user selected certain servers in the Trojanised VNC.

Chinese state-sponsored threat actors targeted semiconductor industry in East Asia beginning in August 2023,"A Chinese state-sponsored hacking group has been targeting the semiconductor industry in East Asia beginning in August 2023, EclecticIQ identified on 5 October 2023. The campaign, which shared overlaps with the Chinese threat actors 'RedHotel' and 'APT27', focused on Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
The attackers utilized a fake PDF document with references to the Taiwanese semiconductor company TSMC in the campaign to deliver the HyperBro malware loader. HyperBro has been tracked in operations since 2018 and documented in use by the Chinese state-backed group APT27. The particular variant deployed against the semiconductor companies showed similarities with a version that Recorded Future had tied to the Chinese state-sponsored actor RedHotel in August 2023. 
The HyperBro version analysed EclecticIQ communicated with an infected Cobra DocGuard server, an encryption solution provided by the Chinese company EsafeNet, to deliver Cobalt Strike codes and a backdoor backdoor, which EclecticIQ tracks as 'ChargeWeapon', to compromised machines. Use of Cobra DocGuard servers for malware distribution has been observed for several distinct threat actors.

Noting the group's singular focus on critical national infrastructure, Symantec decided to track Redfly separately.

According to the report, the affected banking company discovered unusual behaviour in its network in February 2023 and isolated the infected machine.
Mauro Eldritch, a threat analyst at Birmingham Cyber Arms, identified the deployed malware as a remote access Trojan (RAT) that poses as QR code generator for the authentication of online payments to steal money from victims. 
Following the identification of the malware, Eldritch contacted a colleague at the US IT security company Crowdstrike to determine the authorship of the malware. Crowdstrike analysts concluded with a high degree of confidence that Labyrinth Chollima infected the Latin American banking company. In addition, Crowdstrike determined the North Korean hackers had operated undetected within the bank's network for a month.",2023,1,1,,,,media (without further information on source); IT-security company,"[239, 322]",Hijacking without Misuse,[367],Not available - Not available,Critical infrastructure,Finance,[949],"Lazarus Group/Labyrinth Chollima/HIDDEN COBRA/Guardians of Peace/Diamond Sleet fka ZINC/NICKEL ACADEMY/NewRomanic Cyber Army Team/Whois Hacking Team/Appleworm/Group 77/G0032 (Reconnaissance General Bureau, Bureau 121, Unit 180, Lab 110)","Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested",1,15130,"Direct statement in media report (e.g., Reuters article cites the attribution statements by a person) / self-attribution via social media",Media Reports,[235],IT-security community attributes attacker,Technical Reports,[596],CrowdStrike,North America,"Lazarus Group/Labyrinth Chollima/HIDDEN COBRA/Guardians of Peace/Diamond Sleet fka ZINC/NICKEL ACADEMY/NewRomanic Cyber Army Team/Whois Hacking Team/Appleworm/Group 77/G0032 (Reconnaissance General Bureau, Bureau 121, Unit 180, Lab 110)",,6,Asia,"Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested",Non-State Actors,[61],clarin,Unknown,Other/Unknown,Not available,Unknown,[106],"Asia, Europe",Not available,0,HIIK 5,4,0,2023,1,26,Not available,Awareness raising,Awareness Raising,0,,Not available,No,0.0,Not available,Unknown,5,Not available,Other/Unavailable,4,Not available,0,False,Not Available,2,Not available,1,"Hijacking, not used - empowerment (incident scores 1 point in intensity)",0,none,3,none,3,1,Moderate - high political importance,0,1.0,Minor,2,5.0,No system interference/disruption,3.0,No data breach/exfiltration or data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data,No data impact,3,1-10,1.0,1-10,1.0,Not available,0.0,euro,1.0,Indirect (knowingly sanctioning / ordering / ideological / material support by official members of state entities/agencies/units for officially non-state-actors),1,Sovereignty,Conflict and Security Law,[564],Civic / political rights,Human Rights,2,Not available,2.0,0,2023,12,1,Not available,; ; ,Not available,Not available,Civic / political rights,Countermeasures under international law justified (state-atttribution & breach of international law),0,thehackernews,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,
Hacktivist group Anonymous Sudan disrupted user access to social media platform X on 29 August 2023,"The hacktivist group Anonymous Sudan disrupted access to the social media platform X on 29 August 2023 for around two hours, the hacktivists announced via their Telegram channel as early as 1:31 am that night.
This DDoS attack affected users from more than a dozen countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, combining thousands of users.
The group linked its activity to the attempt to pressure the owner of X, Elon Musk, to make his satellite network Starlink available in Sudan to ensure stable Internet access. A professed member of the hacktivist group identifying as Hofa said that the group wanted to raise general awareness about the civil war situation in Sudan.
Hofa and a second individual, who calls himself Crush and acts as the group's spokesperson, shared pictures of their Sudanese passports and screenshots suggesting that they were based in Sudan with BBC correspondent Joe Tidy. During an interview with Tidy, the two members also shared their live location via Telegram, which appeared to show them in Sudan. Former activities of the group have been attributed as false-flag operations by Russian hacktivist group Killnet. Starlink is widely used by the Ukrainian military since the start of the Russian aggression in February 2022.

Rhysida ransomware group launched targeted cyberattack on US hospital network Singing River Health System in August 2023,"Singing River Health System (SRHS), a large US hospital network in Mississippi, which operates Pascagoula Hospital, Ocean Springs Hospital and Gulfport Hospital, serving over 100,000 patients, fell victim to a cyberattack last week. On Monday, 21 August 2023, the hospital detected unusual activity within its network that caused several internal SRHS systems to be taken offline.
The incident is being investigated in collaboration with law enforcement. The hospital has not yet confirmed whether ransomware was involved. 
While operations have not been disrupted, delays in processing lab results and radiology exams are expected. In addition, patients were currently unable to access their electronic medical records platform MySingingRiver.
On 10 September, the Rhysida ransomware group claimed to have hacked the Singing River Health System.
In an analysis from August 8, Checkpoint Research suspects a connection between the ransomware groups Vice Society and Rhysida. Checkpoint Research points to the close temporal relationship between the disappearance of Vice Society and the emergence of Rhysida in May 2023, technical similarities between the threat actors and similarities in the areas in which they are active, namely education and health.",2023,8,19,2023.0,8.0,20.0,media (without further information on source); victim,"[239, 9]",Disruption; Hijacking with Misuse; Ransomware,"[310, 361, 367]",Singing River Health System,Critical infrastructure,Health,[992],Rhysida Ransomware Group,Non-state-group,1,15586,"Direct statement in media report (e.g., Reuters article cites the attribution statements by a person) / self-attribution via social media",Media Reports,[235],Attacker confirms,Media Reports; Self-Attribution,"[235, 615]",Rhysida Ransomware Group,,Rhysida Ransomware Group,Ransomware Groups,5,,Non-state-group,Non-State Actors,[61],twitter,Unknown,Other/Unknown,Not available,Unknown,[106],"Asia, Europe",Not available,0,HIIK 5,4,0,2023,1,26,Not available,Awareness raising,Awareness Raising,0,,Not available,No,0.0,Not available,Unknown,5,Data Encrypted for Impact,Data-related Actions,2,Not available,0,True,Not Available,2,Long-term disruption (> 24h; incident scores 2 points in intensity),0,"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",1,none,3,none,3,4,Moderate - high political importance,0,4.0,Low,0,8.0,Weeks (< 4 weeks),5.0,No data breach/exfiltration or data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data,No data impact,3,1-10,1.0,1-10,1.0,Not available,0.0,euro,1.0,None/Negligent,2,Due diligence; Human rights; Sovereignty,Conflict and Security Law; Due Diligence; Humanitarian Law,"[564, 772, 248]",Civic / political rights,Human Rights,2,Not available,2.0,1,2023,8,20,"Other legal measures on national level (e.g. law enforcement investigations, arrests)",; ; ,Not available,Not available,Civic / political rights,Unfriendly acts/retorsions justified (missing state-attribution & breach ofinternational law OR state-attribution & missing breach of international law),3,therecord.media,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,North America

Ransomware group 'Royal' exfiltrated and leaked patient data from Illinois-based Morris Hospital beginning in April 2023,"The Morris Hospital & Healthcare Centers (Morris Hospital), an Illinois-based healthcare facility (USA), fell victim to a serious cyberattack that compromised the personal information of former and current patients, employees and that of their families. The attack, identified by Morris Hospital on 4 April 2023 and most likely initiated by the 'Royal' ransomware gang, resulted in the exposure of sensitive data such as medical record numbers, diagnosis codes and other confidential information. The attackers managed to penetrate Morris Hospital's systems and exfiltrate data, which was subsequently published on the Royal Ransomware's dark web blog in May.
Morris Hospital has begun notifying affected individuals and clarifying the extent of the intrusion. A letter sent by the hospital to the Maine Attorney General's Office shows that a total of 248,943 people were affected by the attack.

Unknown hackers targeted Freeport McMoRan Inc. in August 2023 ,"Freeport McMoRan Inc, a major copper producer in North America, announced on 11 August 2023 that its information systems had been affected by a cyberattack.
According to an employee, the attack began on the night of 10 August 2023 and caused the company's computer systems to shut down. Although the incident has had only limited impact on copper production so far, there are concerns that prolonged disruptions could affect future operations. Freeport owns significant copper-producing operations, including the Morenci Operations in Greenlee County and the Safford Operations north of Safford, Arizona. Headquartered in Phoenix, the international company also operates the world's largest gold mine in Papua, Indonesia, and is the world's largest molybdenum producer. It is not known whether the indications of a ransom sum have been confirmed. To address the situation, the company initiated a cooperative effort with law enforcement and other agencies.

North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus suspected of stealing nearly $60m from payment processing platform Alphapo on 23 July 2023,"A North Korean state-sponsored hacking group is suspected of stealing nearly $60 million from payment processing platform Alphapo on 23 July 2023, the blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported via Twitter on the same day.
Upon further analysis, ZachXBT suspected the Lazarus group to be behind the attack, on 25 July 2023. Noting parallels to past exploits, the COO of the blockchain security company Halborn supported this assessment. 
In a review of the incident, Halborn CEO Rob Behnke explained that the hack was enabled by the leak of private keys. Access to these private keys allowed the hackers to create transactions to transferred funds to their own wallets.
On 22 August 2023, the FBI warned cryptocurrency companies of a possible USD 40 million transfer of cryptocurrencies by North Korean-affiliated actors, also known as Lazarus, which are linked to cyberattacks on cryptocurrency companies.

Rhysida Ransomware Group executes ransomware attack on Prospect Medical Holdings Inc. causing disruption to computer systems at several US healthcare facilities on 3 August 2023,"The Rhysida ransomware group conducted a ransomware attack against Prospect Medical Holdings Inc., a health care service provider in the United States that manages 16 hospitals across four states in addition to 166 outpatient centres, on 3 August 2023. Following the attack, several of the hospitals reported problems and disruptions. 
At multiple facilities, the computer systems were knocked offline, limiting access to Internet, email and electronic health records and forcing Prospect to suspend certain inpatient services, elective surgeries, outpatient blood draw, physical therapy and to reschedule some appointments. Several facilities had to revert to paper records. At clinics in Connecticut, the emergency departments at Manchester Memorial and Rockville General hospital had to be closed for most of the day of the attack and patients were diverted to other nearby medical centres.

Unknown hackers targeted US-based boat manufacturer Brunswick Corporation,"Unknown hackers targeted the US-based Brunswick Corporation, in particular resulting in disruptions within marine propulsion and engine parts and accessories division, the company announced on 13 June 2023. 
In a second quarter earnings conference call on 27 July 2023, Brunswick Corporation CEO Dave Foulkes declared that the incident caused financial results to fall below initial expectations. While all primary global manufacturing and distribution facilities resumed operations within nine days, the company estimates the financial impact to be $80 million to $85 million of revenue in the quarter. For the full year, Brunswick expects to be able to lower this amount to between $60 million to $70 million, as the company recovers some of the lost production in the coming quarters.
The company assessed a non-recoverable loss of $0.35 in earnings per share as a result of the incident, primarily related to the downtime of high horsepower outboard engine production and reduced sales during the retail season.",2023,1,1,,,,victim,[9],Disruption; Hijacking with Misuse,"[310, 361]",Brunswick Corporation,Critical infrastructure,Critical Manufacturing,[432],Not available,Not available,1,14853,Not available,Other/Unavailable,[449],Not available,Other/Unavailable,[449],Not available,,Not available,Miscellaneous,2,,Not available,Miscellaneous,[39],dragos,Unknown,Other/Unknown,Not available,Unknown,[106],"Asia, Europe",Not available,0,HIIK 5,4,0,2023,1,26,Not available,Awareness raising,Awareness Raising,0,,Not available,No,0.0,Not available,Unknown,5,Not available,Other/Unavailable,4,Not available,0,True,Not Available,2,Long-term disruption (> 24h; incident scores 2 points in intensity),0,"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",1,none,3,none,3,4,Moderate - high political importance,0,4.0,Low,0,10.0,Weeks (< 4 weeks),5.0,No data breach/exfiltration or data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data,No data impact,3,1-10,1.0,1-10,1.0,> 10 Mio - 100 Mio,0.0,dollar,0.0,Not available,3,Sovereignty,Conflict and Security Law,[564],Civic / political rights,Human Rights,2,Not available,2.0,0,2023,12,1,Not available,; ; ,Not available,Not available,Civic / political rights,Unfriendly acts/retorsions justified (missing state-attribution & breach ofinternational law OR state-attribution & missing breach of international law),3,therecord.media,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,

Unknown Threat Actor Exfiltrated Patient Data From Florida-based Tampa General Hospital in May 2023,"Tampa General Hospital (TGH), a well-known non-profit private hospital in Tampa, FL (US), recently announced a data theft that affected 1.2 million patients.

Although the attack was repelled, the hospital confirmed that unauthorised third parties gained access to its network between 12 and 30 May. Although the hackers were prevented from encrypting the hospital's data, certain files containing sensitive patient data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, national insurance numbers, health insurance information, medical record numbers, patient account numbers, dates of services and certain dates of treatment as well as limited treatment information were compromised.

"Unidentified actor gained access to a Pakistani government entity, a public sector bank and a telecommunications provider using the ShadowPad backdoor beginning in mid-February 2022","An unidentified actor gained access to a Pakistani government entity, a public sector bank, and a telecommunications provider using the ShadowPad backdoor beginning in mid-February 2022, the Japanese IT security firm Trend Micro reported in a technical report on 14 July 2023.
Trend Micro assessed the unattributed actors had tempered with the ""E-Office"" application by planting the ShadowPad backdoor in a compromised installer. E-Office is a custom application in use by Pakistani government entities only and designed to help deliver administrative services in a paperless and efficient manner. On 17 July 2023, the Pakistani government agency responsible for E-Office denied that its build environment had been compromised. As the installer was not publicly available at the time of the incident, Trend Micro assumes the three victims detected through its telemetry may have been infected with the trojanized installer through social engineering. 
The ShadowPad backdoor has been shared among Chinese threat actors, in particular Earth Akhlut and Earth Lusca, complicating attribution to a specific group. Considering additional malware components featured in the attack, Trend Micro raises the possible involvement of the Chinese state-sponsored hacking group Calypso or the DriftingCloud threat actor.",2022,2,1,2022.0,9.0,30.0,IT-security company,[322],Data theft; Hijacking with Misuse,"[824, 361]",Not available - Not available - Not available,Critical infrastructure;  State institutions / political system,Finance; Government / ministries; Telecommunications,"[949, 520, 567]",Not available,Not available,1,14444,Not available,Other/Unavailable,[449],Not available,Other/Unavailable,[449],Not available,,Not available,Miscellaneous,2,,Not available,Miscellaneous,[39],dragos,Unknown,Other/Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,[106],"Asia, Europe",Unknown,1,HIIK 5,4,0,2023,1,26,Not available,Awareness raising,Awareness Raising,0,,Not available,No,0.0,Phishing,Deception and Manipulation,1,Data Exfiltration,Data-related Actions,2,Not available,0,False,Non-Sensitive Info,1,Not available,1,"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",1,none,3,none,3,3,Moderate - high political importance,0,3.0,Low,0,6.0,No system interference/disruption,3.0,"Minor data breach/exfiltration (no critical/sensitive information), but no data corruption (deletion/altering) or leaking of data  ",Minor data impact,2,1-10,3.0,1-10,1.0,Not available,0.0,euro,1.0,Not available,3,Sovereignty,Conflict and Security Law,[564],Civic / political rights,Human Rights,2,Not available,2.0,0,2023,12,1,Not available,; ; ,Not available,Not available,Civic / political rights,Unfriendly acts/retorsions justified (missing state-attribution & breach ofinternational law OR state-attribution & missing breach of international law),3,thehackernews,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,
Unknown actor stole patient information from Dr Gary Motykie's plastic surgery practice (USA)on 13 April 2023,"An unknown actor stole information of 3,461 patients from Dr Gary Motykie's plastic surgery practice (USA) on 13 April 2023, as legal counsel of the practice reported to Maine's Attorney General on 23 June 2023. 
The data breach notification from the plastic surgery practice stated that the stolen information may include patient names; social security numbers (if provided); addresses; Driving licence or identification card numbers; financial account or payment card details; intake forms, which may include medical information and history; images taken in connection with the services rendered at the practice; as well as health insurance information (if provided). 
On 5 June 2023, the hackers began leaking samples of the stolen information and demanded $2.5 million from Dr Gary Motykie for the deletion. The leaked information included pictures of the patients, including their faces and/or their exposed chests, together with their personal information.

North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Labyrinth Chollima gained access to command framework of US cloud directory provider JumpCloud beginning on 22 June 2023,"A state-sponsored threat actor gained access to the command framework of US cloud directory provider JumpCloud beginning on 22 June 2023, the company reported in a notice on its website on 12 July 2023.
On 27 June, JumpCloud discovered unusual activity in a specific area of its IT infrastructure that the company traced back to a spear-phishing approach five days earlier. On 5 July, JumpCloud became aware that suspicious activity had permeated to the command frameworks of a few customers.
On 20 July, the senior threat researcher at SentinelOne, Tom Hegel, attributed this cyber incident to a state-sponsored hacking group from North Korea. 
A day later, on 21 July, Reuters published a media report based on findings from the previous day. Initially, Mandiant also attributed this cyber incident to a state-sponsored hacking group from North Korea working for the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), North Korea's military intelligence agency. CrowdStrike went a step further and attributed this cyber incident to the state-sponsored hacking group Labyrinth Chollima, or better known as Lazarus. In addition, anonymous sources said that the previously unknown customers of JumpCloud who had been targeted were cryptocurrency companies.
On 24 July, Mandiant published a technical report on the investigation of one of the affected victims. In this technical report, Mandiant attributed this cyber incident to the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group UNC4889, which is affiliated with the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). UNC4889 focuses on cryptocurrency companies and overlaps with the North Korean cybercriminal hacking group APT43, which also works for the North Korean government.

BlackCat/AlphV ransomware group gained access to servers of Bangladesh Agricultural (Krishi) Bank (BKB) and disrupted operational software in June 2023,"The BlackCat/AlphV ransomware group gained access to the servers of Bangladesh Agricultural (Krishi) Bank (BKB) and disrupted operational software in June 2023.
Around 25 June, BKB officials confirmed to the Bangladeshi press that hackers had gained control of some of its servers on 21 June. The statements further detailed that bank employees noted problems in accessing core banking software the following day, 22 June, leading to the discovery of the intrusion. BKB managing director, Shaukat Ali Khan, reported on 25 June that the bank had recovered its systems. According to the bank's assessments, the incident did not result in disruptions of customer services or data theft. Executive Director and acting spokesperson of BKB, Zakir Hossain Chowdhury, went further, claiming that there had been ""no hacking"" and attributed the incident to server downtime. 
These post-incident assessments deviate from earlier reports by bank officials that the disruptions had affected bank transactions and stand in contrast to the actions announced by AlphV. 
The ransomware note AlphV sent to BKB had claimed the theft of 170 GB of sensitive data on 21 June, in addition to the encryption of data. In communications sent to the Bangladeshi press on 7 July, AlphV disputed BKB statements and announced that it had started to leak stolen data.

Russian ransomware group 'LockBit 3.0' suspected of targeting the Nagoya Port Unified Terminal System (NUTS) of the Japanese Nagoya Harbor Transport Association on 4 July 2023,"The Russian ransomware group 'LockBit 3.0' is suspected of disrupting the Nagoya Port Unified Terminal System (NUTS) of the Japanese Nagoya Harbor Transport Association on 4 July 2023. Port authorities received a ransom note. NUTS controls all container terminals of the port. Its disruption has limited the port in the loading and unloading of containers from trailers, resulting in financial losses to the port and delaying the transfer of goods to and from Japan. The port is Japan's largest and functions as a hub for Toyota's exports and imports. Operations were expected to resume on 6 July. A report by the Financial Times on 29 August noted concerns among high-ranking Japanese officials that the incident may have been conducted by state actors, possibly from China, rather than a criminal group, to probe Japan's defences.
On February 24, 2024, the US-Biden administration announced a new Executive Order ""to bolster the security of the nation’s ports, alongside a series of additional actions that will strengthen maritime cybersecurity"". Anne Neuberger, the White House’s deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technologies, was cited by media reports that the initiative ties to Chinese cyber activity, but also refers to criminal operations such as this incident against the Port of Nagoya.

Ransomware group 'LockBit' suspected of having stolen system information from Taiwanese cloud computing service provider Kinmax Technology's internal testing environment in June 2023,"The ransomware group 'LockBit' is suspected of having stolen system information from Taiwanese cloud computing service provider Kinmax Technology's internal testing environment in June 2023.
The company circulated a notification on 30 June 2023 disclosing the compromise of the testing environment and leak of default configurations, including initial server setups, that Kinmax provides to customers to prepare the deployment of its products. Published data also included customer names. 
'Bassterlord', a LockBit affiliate, first shared details of the intrusion on Twitter, claiming to have compromised the Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer TSMC. The posts were subsequently deleted. 
Shortly after, LockBit listed TSMC on the group's leak site, demanding a ransom of $70 million - one of the highest amounts recorded. 
Referring to details about the data breach at Kinmax, a spokesperson of TSMC clarified that the incident occurred at a supplier and did not affect the company. The spokesperson noted that TSMC subjected hardware components to rigorous security tests prior to their incorporation into company systems, including reviews and adjustments of product configurations. TSMC had suspended data connections with the supplier following notification about the incident, in line with standard operating procedures.
As part of Operation Cronos against the LockBit ransomware group, which was announced on 20 February 2024, the United States District Court of New Jersey indicted four individuals affiliated with the LockBit ransomware group, namely Mikhail Vasiliev, Artur Sungatov, Mikahil Pavlovich Matveev and Ivan Gennadievich Kondratyev.

Alleged Russian false-flag operation Anonymous Sudan disrupted at least three Microsoft services with DDoS attacks in the second week of June 2023,"Alleged Russian false-flag operation Anonymous Sudan disrupted at least three Microsoft services with DDoS attacks during 5-9 June 2023, according to Telegram posts by the hacktivist group as well as subsequent confirmation from Microsoft.
On 5 June, the hacking group, tracked by Microsoft as Storm-1359, disrupted the web portal of Microsoft's cloud-based Outlook email service, first in the morning and then late in the evening. On the same day, the hacker group declared that they were carrying out DDoS attacks in response to the US government's interference in Sudan's internal affairs. Outlook disruptions intermittently continued until 7 June.
On 8 June, the hacker group disrupted access to Microsoft's OneDrive service and on the following day to Microsoft's Azure portal.
The disruption attempts were accompanied by demands of $ 1 million to stop the DDoS attacks. 
On 2 July, Anonymous Sudan further claimed to having obtained credentials for 30 million customer accounts of Microsoft and offered the data for sale for 50,000 $. A Microsoft spokesperson denied the theft of customer data upon request by BleepingComputer on July 3. Past activities by the group have been attributed as an alleged Russian false-flag operation by the hacktivist group Killnet.

Suspected Chinese threat actor UNC4841 exploited zero-day vulnerability in Barracuda Email Security Gateway to conduct espionage against victim organisations in at least 16 countries since 10 October 2022,"Victim organisations using the Email Security Gateway offered by the IT security company Barracuda started receiving emails designed to exploit the zero-day vulnerability CVE-2023-2868 starting on 10 October 2022. The malicious acitivity was first detected on 19 May 2023 by Barracuda, which launched an investigation in cooperation with the threat intelligence company Mandiant. The investigation uncovered a large-scale campaign that in many cases had successfully extracted data from infected systems. Among the victims from at least 16 different countries are academic targets in Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as government officials in Southeast Asia. Nearly a third of the victims are from the public sector. Mandiant assessed with high confidence that the campaign by the threat actor UNC4841 was conducted in support of the People's Republic of China. 
Barracuda distributed a patch to close the vulnerability on the day after it was discovered, on May 20. Concerns about threat actors persisting in virtual or hardware ESG appliances subsequently led the company to advise the immediate replacement of compromised appliances, irregardless of whether patches had been applied.
On 29 August 2023, Mandiant published a subsequent technical report with new findings. According to this report, the cyber incident lasted into June 2023, and especially after Barracuda published the given vulnerability in May 2023, UNC4841 attempted to maintain access to certain already compromised environments they deemed most important with additional malware.

Barracuda distributed a patch to close the vulnerability on the day after it was discovered, on May 20. Concerns about threat actors persisting in virtual or hardware ESG appliances subsequently led the company to advise the immediate replacement of compromised appliances, irregardless of whether patches had been applied.
On 29 August 2023, Mandiant published a subsequent technical report with new findings. According to this report, the cyber incident lasted into June 2023, and especially after Barracuda published the given vulnerability in May 2023, UNC4841 attempted to maintain access to certain already compromised environments they deemed most important with additional malware. The additional malware was the SKIPJACK, DEPTHCHARGE and FOXTROT backdoors and the FOXGLOVE launcher.

Suspected Chinese threat actor UNC4841 exploited zero-day vulnerability in Barracuda Email Security Gateway to conduct espionage against victim organisations in at least 16 countries since 10 October 2022,"Victim organisations using the Email Security Gateway offered by the IT security company Barracuda started receiving emails designed to exploit the zero-day vulnerability CVE-2023-2868 starting on 10 October 2022. The malicious acitivity was first detected on 19 May 2023 by Barracuda, which launched an investigation in cooperation with the threat intelligence company Mandiant. The investigation uncovered a large-scale campaign that in many cases had successfully extracted data from infected systems. Among the victims from at least 16 different countries are academic targets in Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as government officials in Southeast Asia. Nearly a third of the victims are from the public sector. Mandiant assessed with high confidence that the campaign by the threat actor UNC4841 was conducted in support of the People's Republic of China.

The attack lines up with disruptions directed against parts of the Swiss Federal Administration and state-related companies on the previous day and in the previous week against the Swiss Parliament.
The attacks are believed to be a reaction to Switzerland's adoption of an EU sanctions package against Moscow and coincide with the announcement of a video message by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the Swiss Parliament scheduled for 15 June.

Ransomware group Play encrypted data of the Swiss software developer Xplain and stole information belonging to Swiss state authorities,"The Play ransomware group encrypted data of the Swiss software developer Xplain and stole data belonging to Swiss state authorities. 
On 22 May 2023, the Play ransomware group claimed to have stolen approximately 907 GB from Xplain and disclosed an initial sample on 1 June. This sample included contracts, technical specifications, identifiers for access to certain services linked to IT projects within the Swiss Federal Police and some cantonal police forces. In addition, the sample included unspecified documents related to the Federal Office for Customs and Border Security (FOCBS), the RUAG defence company, the Swiss Air-Rescue (Rega), and the Swiss Armed Forces. 
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of Switzerland announced on 8 June that operational data of the Federal Administration may have been part of exfiltrated files. Initially, Xplain gave assurances that client data had not been affected. Both the Federal Police and FOCBS uphold assessments that the stolen data concerning them at a maximum could involve correspondence between their offices and Xplain. The NCSC announced on 14 June that operational data of the Federal Administration had been exfiltrated from Xplain and leaked. According to Swiss media reports disclosed data included security measures of the Federal Police to protect foreign dignitaries and embassies, as well as information relating to Interpol Red Notices. Why this information was stored on Xplain systems, possibly in an unencrypted format, remains subject to federal investigations.
On 10 June, the Neue Züricher Zeitung (NZZ) wrote that data from the Swiss Federal Railways and the canton of Aargau had also been exfiltrated. The data from the canton of Aargau is said to be operational data from error logs that Xplain stored. On 13 June, it became known that the Liechtenstein National Police was also affected, but presumably only project information had been accessed via Xplain.
An NCSC report published on 7 March 2024 indicated that around 1.3 million documents were published on the dark net the aftermath of the theft, with 65,000 documents being relevant to the NCSC. 95% of these files affect the administrative units of the Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP): the Federal Office of Justice, the Federal Office of Police, the State Secretariat for Migration, and the internal IT service center ISC-FDJP. Just over 3% of the data impacts the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS).
Around 5,000 documents contained sensitive information, including personal data (names, email addresses, telephone numbers, and addresses), technical details, classified information, and account passwords, while another small set of only a few hundred files contained IT system documentation, software or architectural data, and passwords.
On 1 May 2024, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) published a press release with three attached investigation reports on the cyber incident against the company Xplain. In his reports, the FDPIC concludes that neither the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol) nor the Federal Office of Customs and Border Security (FOCBS) had clearly agreed with Xplain whether or under what conditions personal data may be stored on their servers as part of support services provided by Xplain. The FDPIC also found that the amount of personal data transferred as part of this process was disproportionate. Furthermore, Xplain, as the processor, did not take appropriate measures to ensure data security or information protection by best practice and stored personal data despite some contractual deletion obligations, the FDPIC wrote.
On the same day, the Swiss Federal Council published a press release with an attached investigation report from the Geneva law firm Oberson Abels on the cyber incident against Xplain. The report reveals that in recent years, productive federal data has been actively transmitted to the IT environment of Xplain AG in a few cases. This occurred during software testing and integration phases or as part of maintenance or support services. 
The Federal Council's press release mentioned the entry into force of the Information Security Act (ISG) on 1 January 2024, which is intended to systematically and sustainably improve security. Accordingly, Administrative units will be required to set up and operate an information security management system (ISMS) by the end of 2026 at the latest. According to the press release, the Federal Council has also decided on measures to prevent future data leaks. These include strengthening security management by, among other things, creating additional security guidelines for collaboration with suppliers by the end of 2024 and strengthening control and audit capabilities. Secondly, a function-related training concept for training and sensitising employees to existing security requirements will be developed by the end of 2024. Thirdly, an overview of the federal authorities' existing means of communication will be drawn up by the end of 2024. In order to further improve the Confederation's data security and learn the lessons from the incident, the Federal Council has instructed the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS) to review the Confederation's basic ICT protection by the end of 2024 and propose any necessary adjustments.",2023,1,1,2023.0,6.0,1.0,attacker,[304],Data theft & Doxing; Disruption; Hijacking with Misuse; Ransomware,"[335, 310, 361, 367]",Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) - None - None - None - Federal Administration of Switzerland,Corporate Targets (corporate targets only coded if the respective company is not part of the critical infrastructure definition);  Critical infrastructure;  State institutions / political system,Civil service / administration; Government / ministries; Transportation,"[385, 520, 738]",Unknown initiator,Non-state-group,2,19438; 19437,"Direct statement in media report (e.g., Reuters article cites the attribution statements by a person) / self-attribution via social media",Media Reports,[235],Media-based attribution; Attacker confirms,Media Reports; Self-Attribution,"[235, 615]",Watson; PLAY,Europe,Not available,Miscellaneous,2,Asia,Non-state-group,Non-State Actors,[61],watson,Unknown,Other/Unknown,Not available,Unknown,[106],"Asia, Europe",Not available,0,HIIK 5,4,1,2023,6,8,State Actors: Stabilizing measures,Awareness raising,Awareness Raising,0,Europe,"National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC, Switzerland)",No,0.0,Not available,Unknown,5,Data Exfiltration; Data Encrypted for Impact,Data-related Actions,2,Not available,0,True,Sensitive Info,3,Long-term disruption (> 24h; incident scores 2 points in intensity),0,"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",1,none,3,none,3,6,Moderate - high political importance,0,6.0,Medium,1,14.0,Months,2.0,Major data breach/exfiltration (critical/sensitive information) & data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data ,Major data impact,1,11-50,0.0,1-10,1.0,Not available,0.0,euro,1.0,None/Negligent,2,Cyber espionage; Due diligence; Sovereignty,Cyber and Technology Law; Conflict and Security Law; Due Diligence,"[688, 564, 772]",Non-state actors,Actors,0,Not available,2.0,3,2023,6,1,"Other legal measures on national level (e.g. law enforcement investigations, arrests)",; ; ,Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland; Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (Switzerland); Federal Department of Finance (Switzerland),Not available,Civic / political rights,Unfriendly acts/retorsions justified (missing state-attribution & breach ofinternational law OR state-attribution & missing breach of international law),3,therecord.media,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,Europe

State-sponsored Vietnamese hacking group OceanLotus gained access to a Vietnamese financial service,"The state-sponsored Vietnamese hacking group OceanLotus gained access to a Vietnamese financial service, the US-based IT security firm Elastic Security Labs assessed with high confidence twice, on 7 March 2022 and in a subsequent report on 9 June 2023.
Elastic tracks the activity as REF4322. This case designation is based on the malware and technology used as well as the observed victimology. The financial service affected is identified as managing capital for business acquisitions and former state-owned enterprises.
In its first report from 2022, Elastic already attributed the cyber incident to the Vietnamese state-sponsored hacker group OceanLotus, at which time they only identified the PHOREAL/RIZZO backdoor. In the second report from 2023, the IT security company Elastic identified the malware loaders DONUTLOADER and P8LOADER as well as POWERSEAL and PIPEDANCE and the previously unknown SPECTRALVIPER malware in addition to the PHOREAL/RIZZO backdoor.

Daixin Ransomware Group encrypted data from US healthcare facility CRHS and leaked data in June 2023,"Columbus Regional Healthcare System (CRHS), a non-profit healthcare facility in North Carolina with 154 licensed beds, fell victim to a ransomware attack carried out by the Daixin ransomware group. The attack took place on 18 May 2023 and concluded in the encryption of CRHS's servers after data had been exfiltrated and backups deleted.
A CRHS representative briefly entered into negotiations with Daixin on 5 June, three days after the hospital servers were encrypted, but discontinued the exchange soon after.
Daixin subsequently leaked more than 250,000 files of the 70 GB of data the group claimed to have exfiltrated from CRHS. A preliminary review of disclosed data did not uncover any sets of patient information. 
CRHS had recently undergone an external security review, a final report from which identified numerous critical and high-risk vulnerabilities. A spokesperson for Daixin claimed CRHS had no network anomaly monitoring systems (IPS - IDS systems) in place.
The FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) warned in a cybersecurity advisory from October 2022 that the Daixin Team ransomware and data extortion group poses an active threat to the healthcare sector.",2023,5,18,,,,IT-security company; attacker,"[322, 304]",Data theft & Doxing; Disruption; Hijacking with Misuse; Ransomware,"[335, 310, 361, 367]",Columbus Regional Healthcare System (CRHS),Critical infrastructure,Health,[992],Daixin Team,Non-state-group,1,14291,"Direct statement in media report (e.g., Reuters article cites the attribution statements by a person) / self-attribution via social media",Media Reports,[235],Attacker confirms,Media Reports; Self-Attribution,"[235, 615]",Daixin Team,,Daixin Team,Ransomware Groups,5,,Non-state-group,Non-State Actors,[61],databreaches,Unknown,Other/Unknown,Not available,Unknown,[106],"Asia, Europe",Not available,0,HIIK 5,4,0,2023,1,26,Not available,Awareness raising,Awareness Raising,0,,Not available,No,0.0,Not available,Unknown,5,Data Exfiltration; Data Encrypted for Impact,Data-related Actions,2,Not available,0,True,Non-Sensitive Info,1,Long-term disruption (> 24h; incident scores 2 points in intensity),0,"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",1,none,3,none,3,5,Moderate - high political importance,0,5.0,Medium,1,11.0,Weeks (< 4 weeks),5.0,"Minor data breach/exfiltration (no critical/sensitive information), data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data  ",Minor data impact,2,1-10,1.0,1-10,1.0,Not available,0.0,euro,1.0,None/Negligent,2,Due diligence; Human rights; Sovereignty,Conflict and Security Law; Due Diligence; Humanitarian Law,"[564, 772, 248]",Civic / political rights,Human Rights,2,Not available,2.0,0,2023,12,1,Not available,; ; ,Not available,Not available,Civic / political rights,Unfriendly acts/retorsions justified (missing state-attribution & breach ofinternational law OR state-attribution & missing breach of international law),3,databreaches,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,
Pro-Ukrainian hacker group Cyber Anarchy Squad disrupted operations of Russian telecommunications company Infotel JSC and defaced other Russian websites in June 2023,"The pro-Ukrainian hacker group Cyber Anarchy Squad disrupted the Russian telecommunications company Infotel JSC, the hackers claimed via their Telegram channel on 8 June 2023. Infotel in a statement acknowledged being targeted and noted that network equipment had been damaged. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance, an umbrella group of various hacktivist cells, declared central systems at Infotel had been ""wiped, including servers (backups too) and core routers (configs reset, firmware erased)"". As a result, Infotel had been unable to route Internet traffic. 
The Ukrainian news portal Economichna Pravda reported on the same day that the disruption of Infotel JSC resulted in banks being unable to get into their computer systems and make payments, as Infotel JSC is responsible for telecommunications between the Russian Central Bank and other banks and organizations. Coinciding with the disruption, several Russian websites were defaced to show a picture of a Ukrainian soldier and messages blessing Ukraine's counteroffensive that had been initiated a few days earlier.

North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus potentially responsible for stealing $100 million by compromising cryptocurrency wallet platform Atomic Wallet in June 2023,"The North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus stole $100 million in cryptocurrency assets by compromising user wallets on the decentralised cryptocurrency wallet service Atomic Wallet in early June 2023. Atomic Wallet supports a wide range of popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), and others. The company determined that less than 1% of its monthly active users had been affected by the hack.
Researchers at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic attributed the incident on 6 June 2023 to the Lazarus Group “with a high level of confidence” pointing to similarities in laundering techniques observed in previous attacks associated with Lazarus.
On 22 August 2023, the FBI warned cryptocurrency companies of a possible USD 40 million transfer of cryptocurrencies by North Korean TraderTraitor-affiliated actors, also known as Lazarus, which are linked to cyberattacks on cryptocurrency companies.

Unspecified Chinese threat actor gained access to information systems of the Taiwanese government and critical infrastructure in February 2023,"An unspecified Chinese threat actor gained access to information systems of the Taiwanese government and related entities as well as critical infrastructure in February 2023, the Dutch IT security company EclecticIQ concluded with moderate confidence on 2 June 2023.
The hackers used four known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-21839; CVE-2021-3129; CVE-2020-2551; and CVE-2021-44228) and a variety of open-source tools, traced back to Chinese underground fora, including the modified version of Cobalt Strike referred to as ""Cat"".
For example, the hackers managed to gain access to the CCTV cameras of the Directorate General of Highways (MOTC) in Taiwan leveraging SONAS software used by a compromised target, which allows remote control of hardware devices.
In its attribution findings, EclecticIQ noted TTP overlaps between the observed threat actor and the Chinese state-sponsored hacking group ""Budworm"".

They claimed to have stolen around 10TB of data, including customer information, data stored in PrivateArk and SAP Back Office, and demanded at least an eight-figure ransom. Furthermore, they announced that they were acting for purely financial motives and that if the ransom was not paid, they would be willing to publish the stolen data on the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group's website.
Then, on 28 April, ALPHV/BlackCat threatened via their website for the last time that they will disclose the stolen data if Western Digital does not pay the ransom. Cybersecurity analyst Dominic Alvieri reported that the ALPHV/BlackCat disclosed 29 screenshots of emails, documents, videos, and conference calls alleged documenting Western Digital's cyberattack response, in the endeavor to prove that they still had access to Western Digital's computer systems.

Unknown actors stole cryptocurrencies from individuals with AT&T email addresses,"Unknown actors have been stealing cryptocurrencies from individuals with AT&T email addresses for apparently several months, according to a report by TechCrunch.
TechCrunch was contacted by an anonymous source in early April who claimed that unknown hackers had access to the internal networks of the US telecommunications company AT&T. Through this they could create mail keys for any user. Mail keys are unique credentials that AT&T email users can use to log into their accounts without having to enter their passwords. The hackers then reset passwords of individuals on their cryptocurrency exchanges and transferred funds from compromised accounts. A spokesperson for A&T declared that there ""was no intrusion into any system for this exploit."" Instead, the ""bad actors used an API access"".
The informant told TechCrunch that the hackers have made away with $15 to $20 million. These claims have not been independently verified. One victim confirmed that $134,000 was stolen from their Coinbase account. Another victim announced that they were already attacked several times going back to November 2022.

Pro-Russian Hacking Group Zarya disrupted Canadian gas pipeline on 25 February 2023,"According to leaked US intelligence documents, Zarya, a suspected spin-off of the pro-Russian hacktivist group Killnet, attacked a Canadian gas pipeline in February 2023.  While the activity did not cause any physical damage, Zarya - in communications with Russia's domestic intelligence service FSB from 15 February - claimed that it could increase valve pressure and trigger emergency shutdowns. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appeared to confirm the incident, acknowledging reports about the event and stating “that there was no physical damage to any Canadian energy infrastructure following cyberattacks”. The US intelligence assessment reported that the “F.S.B. officers anticipated a successful operation would cause an explosion at the gas distribution station, and were monitoring Canadian news reports for indications of an explosion”. If executed, the activities would have marked a first, as the US intelligence community has not previously linked disruptive operations against Western critical infrastructure to pro-Russian hacking groups. Based on the intelligence report, the threat actors succeeded in compromising a Canadian IP address at the gas pipeline company on 25 February. Signals intelligence collected on the group showed claims of the attack inflicting significant damage to the company’s profits. The actors retained their presence at least until 27 February, awaiting possible further instructions, although the leaked document concluded that the activities were focused on causing “loss of income for Canadians” and not aimed at physical harm.",2023,2,25,2023.0,2.0,27.0,"third-party-actor (e.g., Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, whistleblowers) or authorities of another state",[935],Disruption; Hijacking with Misuse,"[310, 361]",Not available,Critical infrastructure,Energy,[942],Zarya,"Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested",1,10029,"Anonymous statement in media report (e.g., Reuters article cites the attribution statements of unnamed officials, or persons with knowledge into the matter etc.)",Media Reports,[235],Attribution by receiver government / state entity,Political Actions/Statements,[973],US Department of Defense (Pentagon),North America,Zarya,,6,Asia,"Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested",Non-State Actors,[61],securityaffairs,International power; Resources; System / ideology; Territory,"Resources and Territory, Power and Authority, Ideology and System",System/ideology; Territory; Resources; International power; Third-party intervention / third-party affection,External Intervention; Resources; Politics,"[925, 91, 82]","Asia, Europe",Yes / HIIK intensity,2,HIIK 5,4,0,2023,1,26,Not available,Awareness raising,Awareness Raising,0,,Not available,No,0.0,Not available,Unknown,5,Not available,Other/Unavailable,4,Not available,0,True,Not Available,2,Long-term disruption (> 24h; incident scores 2 points in intensity),0,"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",1,none,3,none,3,4,"Very high political importance (e.g., critical infrastructure, military) - intensity multiplied by 1.5",2,6.0,Low,0,6.0,Days (< 7 days),1.0,No data breach/exfiltration or data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data,No data impact,3,1-10,1.0,1-10,1.0,Not available,0.0,euro,1.0,Indirect (knowingly sanctioning / ordering / ideological / material support by official members of state entities/agencies/units for officially non-state-actors),1,Sovereignty,Conflict and Security Law,[564],Civic / political rights,Human Rights,2,Not available,2.0,0,2023,12,1,Not available,; ; ,Not available,Not available,Civic / political rights,Countermeasures under international law justified (state-atttribution & breach of international law),0,securityaffairs,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,

An unspecified subgroup of the Iranian state-sponsored hacking group Mint Sandstorm aka PHOSPHORUS gained access to U.S. transportation and energy companies as well as individuals with ties to security and policy communities beginning in late 2021,"An unspecified subgroup of the Iranian state-sponsored hacking group Mint Sandstorm aka PHOSPHORUS gained access to U.S. transportation and energy companies as well as individuals with ties to security and policy communities beginning in late 2021, reported the IT-company Microsoft on 18 April 2023.
Mint Sandstorm is the new name of PHOSPHORUS under Microsoft's new naming rules. PHOSPHORUS is an Iranian state-sponsored hacker group of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The unspecified subgroup is characterized by specialization in hacking and data theft of sensitive information from high-value targets.
The Iranian proxy specifically attacked U.S. seaports, energy companies, transit systems, and a major utilities and gas entity. The hacking group's goal was to carry out destructive cyberattacks in retaliation for three cyber attacks that Iran attributed to the United States and Israel. These were a cyberattack on a major Iranian seaport in 2020, the disruption of the Iranian railway in 2021, and the crash of gas station payments in late 2021. They also successfully fished individuals associated with high-value think tanks or universities in Israel, North America, and Europe. 
The hackers used a variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Strikingly, they exploited recently published vulnerabilities in 2023. For example, Mint Sandstorm began exploiting CVE-2022-47966 in Zoho ManageEngine on January 19, 2023, the same day the POC became public.

Alleged Russian false-flag group Anonymous Sudan disrupted the websites of unspecified Israeli Banks and the postal service during Iran's Quds day on 14 April 2023,"The alleged Russian false-flag group Anonymous Sudan hits the websites of unspecified Israeli Banks and the postal service with a DDoS attack during Iran's Quds Day on 14 April 2023. 
The attack on the websites led to a temporary service outage. The disruption was limited and regularly activity resumed shortly thereafter.
In a Telegram post, Anonymous Sudan claimed to have stolen sensitive information and to have attacked government agencies in addition to banks. These claims remain unverified. The post by Anonymous Sudan included no mention of the Israel Postal Service.
On 30 March 2023, Trustwave published a technical report on Anonymous Sudan and concluded that it was a subgroup of the pro-Russian hacktivist group Killnet, thereby further corroborating earlier reporting by TrueSec.

After being hacked, the monitors of the system displayed a message stating ""You have been hacked, Down with Israel"". At least ten farmers could not water their fields, moreover, scheduled watering was stopped. The disruptions were reportedly resolved by Israeli authorities on the same day, but the origins of the hackers remained unknown.

Unknown hacker stole cryptocurrencies worth 197 million USD from Euler Finance,"On 13 March 2023, the UK cryptocurrency lending platform Euler Finance was attacked by an unknown hacker stealing assets worth 197 million USD. The platform subsequently offered a 1 million USD reward for information on the attacker. Chainanalysis reported that on 17 March 100 ETH of the funds stolen in the Euler hack were transferred to a wallet that had previously received funds stolen in the Axie Infinity Ronin Bridge hack traced to the North Korea-backed Lazarus group.

Upon the successful theft of login information, the observed attackers paused their activities, indicating a multi-phase strategy that separates the use of backdoors and efforts to ensure persistence from the activities to obtain credentials and access. The reporting cybersecurity companies consider it highly likely that these attacks were carried out by a Chinese cyber espionage actor linked to Operation Soft Cell and conclude with moderate certainty that Gallium, one of the threat actors associated with Soft Cell, is involved in the attacks. On April 20, Symantec reported on a continuation of the attack, stating that two subsidiaries of the affected Middle Eastern telecommunication companies in Asia and Africa have been compromised for intelligence gathering purposes by the Chinese APT Othorene (aka Gallium), with potential links to APT41.

According to BleepingComputer, data was offered for sale on a hacker forum on 6 March by a user named IntelBroker, who claims it was stolen during a breach of the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority that manages the DC Health Link health insurance marketplace. A sampling of the stolen files found that the dataset contained sensitive personal information on about 170,000 people, including names, birth dates, home addresses, Social Security numbers and health insurance details. Among them, according to current figures, more than two dozen current or former members of Congress are also said to have been affected.  This led to a congressional hearing. The FBI and the Capitol Police are still investigating the incident. Another hacker calling himself ""Denfur"" also claims that the attack was born out of Russian patriotism, but independent verification is still pending.

Three hackers target a variety of Dutch and international organizations with ransomware attacks since March 2021,"On 23 January 2023, the cybercrime team of the Amsterdam police arrested three men, two of them from the Netherlands, for computer intrusion, data theft, extortion, and money laundering. 
The hackers illegally penetrated the networks of various companies and organisations, stole personal information from them, demanded a ransom for it and, in certain cases, published the stolen information despite having received the ransom.  
The affected targets are thousands of Dutch and international organisations, including catering companies, training institutes, webshops for software companies, social media and critical infrastructure. The director of one affected company, Ticketcounter, Sjoerd Bakker, reported his encounter with the hackers and how he dealt with the theft of 1.5 million records of customer data. 
One hacker worked for the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD), a group of volunteers fighting cybercrime. On 24 February 2023, one day after the police announced the arrest, the DIVD commented on their former member and took immediate action.

Anonymous Sudan targeted the websites of several Swedish authorities and companies on 19 February 2023,"On 19 February, the websites of several Swedish authorities and companies were down or not functioning properly due to DDoS attacks, including Kivra, Vattenfall, SOS Alarm and PTS. A group referring to itself as Anonymus Sudan claimed responsibility for the attack.

Pro-Western hacker group Against the West (ATW) stole source code and other data from Chinese government agencies and state-owned enterprises since 2021,"A report by Chinese IT security company Qi An Pangu Lab alleges that pro-western hacker group Against the West (ATW) stole source code and other data from over 100 Chinese government agencies and state-owned enterprises since 2021.

Amplifying reporting by the Global Times, a Chinese state-run media outlet, without providing supporting evidence claims that the group has displayed a willingness to share information with US and European intelligence services and accepted direct taskings. Members of ATW self-identified as former intelligence officers in an interview for DataBreaches in 2022.

Swiss security researcher Maia Arson Crimew obtained a copy of the US No Fly List via an unprotected server of US airline CommuteAir in January 2023,"Swiss security researcher Maia Arson Crimew identified an unprotected Jenkins server operated by the US airline CommuteAir during the week of 9 January, according to a blog post on her website. Project files stored on this development server contained login information to Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure used by the airline. On the AWS servers, Crimew discovered records that an airliine representative confirmed were a 2019 copy of the US No Fly List, containing more than 1.5 million entries.
The No Fly List, maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) within the FBI, includes individuals prohibited from traveling on commercial flights within, into or out of the United States. 
The Swiss hacker made data from the No Fly List available to journalists upon request via the whistleblower platform DDoS Secrets.
Republican Congressman Dan Bishop, a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, demanded an enquiry into why the copy of the No Fly List was not better protected.

North Korean Threat Actor Lazarus Targeted South Korean Chemical Sector In 2022 as part of Operation Dream Job continuation dubbed Pompilus,"According to Symantec, the North Korean APT group Lazarus has conducted a cyberespionage operation that targets the chemical sector in South Korea. It is assessed as a continuation of the group's Operation Dream Job Campaign, which first began in August 2020 and continued to evolve over the next few years. The Operation Dream Job is known for utilizing inauthentic job offers containing malicious links or attachments that install malware for cyberespionage purposes. The attack starts with a malicious HTM file which is copied to a DLL file (called scskapplink.dll) and then ""injected into the legitimate system management software INISAFE Web EX Client."" Google research identified two North Korean campaigns that exploited zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-0609), one of which was Operation Dream Job (the other being Operation AppleJeus). Symantec found evidence that supported this fact and that this activity, dubbed ""Pompilus"", is a continuation of this hacking campaign based on file hashes, file names, and tools that were observed in previous Dream Job campaigns. Further investigation by Symantec revealed that the Lazarus group's tactics have evolved to include sophisticated methods for maintaining persistence and evading detection in the targeted networks. The cyberespionage campaign is part of a broader effort by the Lazarus group to gather sensitive information and intellectual property from the chemical sector, likely to advance North Korea's strategic and economic objectives in this field.

"Pro-Russian group Killnet targets Japanese websites in DDOS attack on September 6, 2022","KillNet stated on September 7, 2022, on its Telegram channel that they have declared war against Japan due to their anti-Russian campaign during the Ukraine-Russian war. The Russian-affiliated hackers claimed responsibility for a DDoS attack, which began on September 6, 2022, and impacted Japanese companies and 20 websites across four government ministries. During the attack, some of the impacted websites were online public services, the tax authority’s electronic system, the digital agency, and the education ministry. The group also claimed to have temporarily disabled the websites for Maxi (a social networking site), the subway of Tokyo, and the port of Nagoya. Japanese officials stated that no data had leaked publicly and they were hesitant to attribute the attack to any group. However, Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, released an update on the attack that stated that foreign interference was suspected. IT experts, Check Point Software, did confirm that Killnet was responsible for the disruption. Chief Cabinet Secretary Matsuno further stated that an official investigation will be conducted by the Japanese National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity. Services were restored by Japanese authorities within a few hours and reporting confirmed that by September 8, 2022, the websites were accessible.
Reporting by Cybersecurity Insiders states that Killnet is funded by Moscow for the purpose of waging cyber war against countries that are allied with Ukraine in the Ukraine-Russian war. Additionally, there is a territorial dispute between Russia and Japan since World War II over the Kuril Islands and both nation states claim the land as their sovereign territory.

"Pro Ukrainian hacktivist Team OneFist attacks Russian Rostelecom in Operation Sidewinder, starting August 29, 2022","Anonymous-affiliated hacktivist group, Team OneFist, that was created with the help of the IT army of Ukraine according to the group`s website, claimed to attack Russian telecommunication infrastructure (tecon[.]ru) from August 29 until September 1, 2022. The attack was timed for ultimate impact and coincided with the Kherson counter-attack in Ukraine against Russian military forces in order for Kremlin officials to not be able to communicate with field military commanders.  The hacktivists called the ""Operation Sidewinder"" (OpSidewinder) and claimed that it is part of the broader efforts of Anonymous to defend Ukraine in the Ukraine-Russia War (#OpRussia). The attack targeted the voice and data capabilities of Russia attacking the largest digital service provider, Rostelecom. Groups affliliated with Ukraine assisted Team OneFist to attack Rostelecom. Voltage, the leader of the group, provided exclusive information about the attack to International Business Times. The intended impact of the cyber attack was meant to slow Russian communications and, thus, slow their Russian military response. ""The hackers worked round the clock for three days to brick 800 Rostelecom routers and voice gateways,"" which are ""routers that carry VoIP/Voice traffic."" Each router would require 20 minutes to reprogram and all 800 routers could be reprogrammed in over 266 hours. A faster repair would require that the routers be replaced or for commanders to communicate via cell phones. During the attack, the Rostelecom attempted to recover the ability to communicate on 45 voice gateways; however, the hacktivists were able to disable these recovery efforts.

Likely China-linked group RedEcho has been targeting India's energy sector since 2020,"According to Recorded Future, a likely China-linked group named RedEcho has been targeting the Indian energy sector since mid-2020 by using infrastructure tracked by Recorded Future as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE. The attacks occured in the context of the India-China border clashes that have been taking place since 5 May 2020, possibly indicating efforts to develop leverage through the pre-positioning of malware on strategic assets. RedEcho uses some TTPs that have been used before by other Chinese state-sponsored groups such as APT41 and Tonto Team. However, there is insufficient evidence to attribute the activities to an existing group, so the report attributes the activities to RedEcho. Recorded Future lists twelve targets of the group, which are mainly organisations in the power generation and transmission sector. However, targets in the maritime sector were also affected.

TA428 used Windows malware to target Eastern European governments and entities and departments in Afghanistan since 2021,"According to Kaspersky ICS CERT experts, a Chinese APT group known as TA428 (APT TA428/Colourful Panda/Vicious Panda/BRONZE DUDLEY) utilized Windows malware in targeted attacks on military-industrial-complex enterprises; public institutions; and government entities, such as agencies, ministries, and departments in various Eastern European countries (Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine) as well as Afghanistan. The bad actors penetrated and, in some cases, hijacked the IT infrastructure. The goal of this activity was for cyber espionage purposes. Penetration was achieved via spear-phishing emails, which in some cases utilized not publicly available information.

TA428 used Windows malware to target Eastern European governments and entities and departments in Afghanistan since 2021,"According to Kaspersky ICS CERT experts, a Chinese APT group known as TA428 (APT TA428/Colourful Panda/Vicious Panda/BRONZE DUDLEY) utilized Windows malware in targeted attacks on military-industrial-complex enterprises; public institutions; and government entities, such as agencies, ministries, and departments in various Eastern European countries (Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine) as well as Afghanistan. The bad actors penetrated and, in some cases, hijacked the IT infrastructure. The goal of this activity was for cyber espionage purposes. Penetration was achieved via spear-phishing emails, which in some cases utilized not publicly available information.

Ukrainian IT Army targeted the Central Bank of Russia in November 2022 with hack-and-leak operation,"The Ukrainian hacktivist group IT Army announced on 3 November 2022 that it had hacked the Russian Central Bank. The group claims to have stolen 27,000 files amounting to 2.6 GB from the central bank and then released them on Anonfile. The Ukrainian Minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, announced on Telegram that the IT Army had obtained information on personnel, specialised automated banking systems, output files and KPI systems, among other things.

A target list published by KillNet on the group's Telegram channel included 49 domains related to airports in more than half of the countries' states. The DDOS attacks were significant enough to overwhelm the servers hosting sites where travelers booked flights and updates on flights were also impacted. Some of the inaccessible airport websited were: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD). The DDOS attacks were confirmed by an official at Department of Homeland Security; however, an official from CISA refused to comment on the attribution of the attacks.

Following the attacks, the FBI stated on November 4, 2022: ""Coinciding with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the FBI is aware of Pro-Russian hacktivist groups employing DDoS attacks to target critical infrastructure companies with limited success."" The FBI further stated that DDoS attacks have a minor impact on services provided to users because these attacks ""target public-facing infrastructure like websites instead of the actual services.""

These sites didn't appear randomly selected since all had been vocal in their support of Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The JavaScript, when loaded, coopted the device and forced the visitors' browser to perform HTTP GET requests to each of the sites listed above. This activity occurred in the background and the users were unaware except for their devices operating slower. ""Each request to the targeted websites will utilize a random query string so that the request is not served through a caching service, such as Cloudflare or Akamai, and is directly received by the server being attacked."" ""developer Andrii Savchenko states that hundreds of WordPress sites are compromised to conduct these attacks."" According to Avast, the same script was found on compromised websites as early as March 7th, 2022. According to BleepingComputer, the script was found on GitHub and one website found to contain this malicious script was https://stop-russian-desinformation.near.page, which is a pro-Ukrainian site and the attacks were against Russian targets.

"Several hours before the Russian invasion in February 2022, IRIDIUM attacked more than a dozen organizations in Ukraine using FoxBlade malware","According to Microsoft, just before the Russian invasion on February 24, 2022, the IRIDIUM group (aka Sandworm) used the FoxBlade malware (aka HermeticWiper) to launch a destructive cyber attack on Ukrainian organizations. The attack aimed to destroy over 300 systems in government, IT, energy, and finance sectors. The malware was detected on February 23, 2022, but the attackers had likely gained access to the network as early as December 2021. The specific access vector remains unclear, but the attackers used various methods, including exploiting Microsoft Exchange Server and SQL Server vulnerabilities. The HermeticWiper malware corrupted data, disabled backup services, and rendered targeted computer systems inoperable, impacting Ukraine, Lithuania, and Latvia. The attack was likely related to the escalating conflict in Ukraine, with the goal of crippling local IT systems and hindering the government's response capabilities. As of May 2022, the HermeticWiper attacks remained a continued risk, leading to joint advisories from CISA and the FBI for organizations to protect against such threats.",2022,2,23,2022.0,2.0,23.0,IT-security company,[322],Disruption; Hijacking without Misuse,"[310, 367]",Not available - Not available,Corporate Targets (corporate targets only coded if the respective company is not part of the critical infrastructure definition);  Critical infrastructure;  Critical infrastructure;  State institutions / political system;  State institutions / political system,Defence industry; Energy; Finance; Government / ministries; Military; Transportation,"[404, 942, 949, 520, 436, 738]","Sandworm/APT44/VOODOO Bear/Quedagh/TeleBots/FROZENBARENTS/IRON VIKING/Black Energy/Seashell Blizzard fka IRIDIUM/ELECTRUM/G0034 (GRU, Main Centre for Special Technologies (GTsST) Military Unit 74455)",State,1,12193,"Technical report (e.g., by IT-companies, Citizen Lab, EFF)",Technical Reports,[596],IT-security community attributes attacker,Technical Reports,[596],Microsoft,North America,"Sandworm/APT44/VOODOO Bear/Quedagh/TeleBots/FROZENBARENTS/IRON VIKING/Black Energy/Seashell Blizzard fka IRIDIUM/ELECTRUM/G0034 (GRU, Main Centre for Special Technologies (GTsST) Military Unit 74455)",,6,Asia,State,State Actors,[975],msrc-blog.microsoft,International power; Resources; System / ideology; Territory,"Resources and Territory, Power and Authority, Ideology and System",System/ideology; Territory; Resources; International power,Resources; Politics,"[91, 82]","Asia, Europe",Yes / HIIK intensity,2,HIIK 5,4,0,2023,1,26,Not available,Awareness raising,Awareness Raising,0,,Not available,No,0.0,Not available,Unknown,5,Data Exfiltration,Data-related Actions,2,Not available,0,True,Not Available,2,Long-term disruption (> 24h; incident scores 2 points in intensity),0,"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",1,none,3,none,3,4,Moderate - high political importance,0,4.0,Low,0,6.0,Day (< 24h),0.0,No data breach/exfiltration or data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data,No data impact,3,11-50,0.0,1-10,0.0,Not available,0.0,euro,1.0,Direct (official members of state entities / agencies / units responsible),0,Sovereignty,Conflict and Security Law,[564],Civic / political rights,Human Rights,2,High,0.0,0,2023,12,1,Not available,; ; ,Not available,Not available,Civic / political rights,Countermeasures under international law justified (state-atttribution & breach of international law),0,twitter,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,

APT3 stole at least 407 gigabytes of data from the company in the Western District of Pennsylvania and elsewhere, which included files from Siemens' energy, technology, and transportation businesses. APT3`s usual initial access vector as described in the indictment was spear phishing. The same indictment also detailed APT3 attacks on Trimble Inc. and Moody`s. Notably, the US DoJ indictment did only name the indicted individuals and their official positions within Boyusec, but neither their membership with APT3, nor Boyusec`s reported affiliation with the MSS, which was already publicly known at that time, especially due to the blog posts by the anonymous threat intelligence collective Intrusion Truth.

Power Grid US Incident,"According to a Wall Street Journal report citing details from anonymous current and former US security officials, cyber spies have infiltrated the US power grid and left behind software programmes that could be used to disrupt the grid.
The threat actors are believed to have been on a mission to navigate the US power grid and its controls. While the intruders did not attempt to damage the power grid or other critical infrastructure, officials warned that they could try to do so in the event of a crisis or war.
The intruders were not detected by the companies responsible for the infrastructure, but by US intelligence agencies, officials said.
Officials said other infrastructure systems, such as water or sewage systems, were also at risk.

Operation Troy: North Korean State Sponsored Lazarus Group Conducts DDoS Attacks Against US and South Korean Targets in July 2009,"Operation Troy is one of the earliest known cyber espionage campaigns by the Lazarus Group, which took place between 2009 and 2012. It was primarily directed against the South Korean government in Seoul, but also against American targets and mostly utilised DDoS attacks, which were already considered unsophisticated but effective at the time. 
The first major incident in this operation, often referred to as the first wave, occurred on 4 July 2009 (on the Independence Day in the United States) and affected both the US and South Korea, hitting sites such as government entities like the White House and the Pentagon, but also the New York Stock Exchange, the Washington Post, NASDAQ and Amazon. 
On 7 and 9 July (unofficially the second and third waves), mainly targeted South Korean entities such as the Ministry of Defence, National Intelligence Service, National Assembly and South Korean banks, but also the US State Department.

The attacks were carried out using the malware programmes Mydoom and Dozer, which attacked numerous websites and marked the ""Independence Day reminder"" in the master boot record (MBR) of the affected systems.",2009,7,4,2009.0,7.0,9.0,IT-security company,[322],Data theft; Disruption; Hijacking with Misuse,"[824, 310, 361]",None - None,Corporate Targets (corporate targets only coded if the respective company is not part of the critical infrastructure definition);  Critical infrastructure;  State institutions / political system;  State institutions / political system;  State institutions / political system,Civil service / administration; Finance; Government / ministries; Intelligence agencies; Judiciary; Legislative,"[385, 949, 520, 74, 71, 843]","Lazarus Group/Labyrinth Chollima/HIDDEN COBRA/Guardians of Peace/Diamond Sleet fka ZINC/NICKEL ACADEMY/NewRomanic Cyber Army Team/Whois Hacking Team/Appleworm/Group 77/G0032 (Reconnaissance General Bureau, Bureau 121, Unit 180, Lab 110)",State,1,15004,"Technical report (e.g., by IT-companies, Citizen Lab, EFF)",Technical Reports,[596],IT-security community attributes attacker,Technical Reports,[596],Not available,,"Lazarus Group/Labyrinth Chollima/HIDDEN COBRA/Guardians of Peace/Diamond Sleet fka ZINC/NICKEL ACADEMY/NewRomanic Cyber Army Team/Whois Hacking Team/Appleworm/Group 77/G0032 (Reconnaissance General Bureau, Bureau 121, Unit 180, Lab 110)",,6,Asia,State,State Actors,[975],group-ib,International power; System / ideology,"Power and Authority, Ideology and System",System/ideology; International power,Politics,[82],"Asia, Europe",Yes / HIIK intensity,2,HIIK 3,2,0,2023,1,26,Not available,Awareness raising,Awareness Raising,0,,Not available,Yes,3.0,Not available,Unknown,5,Data Exfiltration,Data-related Actions,2,Not available,0,True,Non-Sensitive Info,1,Short-term disruption (< 24h; incident scores 1 point in intensity),2,"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",1,none,3,none,3,4,Moderate - high political importance,0,4.0,Not available,3,0.0,No system interference/disruption,3.0,No data breach/exfiltration or data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data,No data impact,3,1-10,0.0,1-10,0.0,Not available,0.0,euro,1.0,Not available,3,Human rights; Sovereignty,Conflict and Security Law; Humanitarian Law,"[564, 248]",Civic / political rights,Human Rights,2,Not available,2.0,0,2023,12,1,Not available,; ; ,Not available,Not available,Civic / political rights,Unfriendly acts/retorsions justified (missing state-attribution & breach ofinternational law OR state-attribution & missing breach of international law),3,mcafee,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,

North Korean State-Sponsored Lazarus Group Steals $81 Million from Bangladesh Central Bank in Cyber Heist on February 2016,"In February 2016, the Bangladesh Central Bank fell victim to a major cyber theft that was later almost certainly attributed to the notorious North Korean Lazarus Group. This sophisticated cybercrime, known as the ""Bangladesh Central Bank Heist"", utilised sophisticated ""SWIFT Client"" malware. This malware allowed the hackers to penetrate the bank's SWIFT system - a global financial communications network used by more than 11,000 institutions - and issue fraudulent transfer orders. The attack began on 4 February 2016 and targeted the Bangladesh Central Bank's account at the US Federal Reserve Bank. Despite aiming to transfer funds totalling nearly $1 billion, the hackers managed to divert around $81 million to accounts in the Philippines. The operation was undermined by a simple but crucial mistake: a misspelled word in one of the transfer requests that aroused suspicion and led to the transaction being cancelled.
The investigation into the heist, led by US firm FireEye, Mandiant division, and World Informatix Cyber Security, uncovered evidence of malware being installed on the bank's system retrospectively in January 2016. The investigation revealed that the hackers had intimate knowledge of the bank's internal procedures for international payments and wire transfers - making the cyber heist possible.
US prosecutors, the FBI and cybersecurity firms such as Symantec Corp and BAE Systems concluded that the Lazarus Group was behind the heist based on the use of Lazarus-typical TTPs.

Chinese state-sponsored group APT3 (aka Gothic Panda) spied on the US company Trimble Inc. for several months until at least March 2016,"Chinese state-sponsored group APT3 (aka Gothic Panda), spied on the US company Trimble Inc. from December 2015 until at least March 2016, according to an US Department of Justice Indictment from September 2016 against three members of APT3 which were employees of the Chinese IT-company Boyusec, a front for the Ministry of State Security (MSS). Trimble Inc. was working on its Commercial GNSS Project at that time. APT3 stole at least 275 megabytes of data from the company, which was in part highly confidential and sensitive, because of its connection to the Commercial GNSS Project.

"North Korean State-Sponsored Hacking Group Lazarus Launched WannaCry Ransomware Attack Infecting Over 200,000 Computers in 150 Countries, Including Major Corporations and the UK National Health Service in May 2017","The WannaCry ransomware attack that broke out in May 2017 ranks as a major global ransomware incident. The attack affected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries and impacted companies such as FedEx, Honda, Nissan, and the UK National Health Service. WannaCry is a ransomware that targets Windows operating systems that have not been patched with a specific update offered by Microsoft since March 2017 and encrypts certain user files on the computer. Utilizing the EternalBlue exploit, the ransomware was able to spread rapidly by infecting other vulnerable systems on the same network. The ransomware initially set a ransom of 300 USD (in Bitcoin) and was later increased to 600 USD. Some victims only had a few days to respond to the ransomware demand - otherwise, they risked losing their data. The security authorities subsequently attributed the attack to the Lazarus Group, which is linked to North Korea, although some researchers dispute this attribution. The spread of the attack was inadvertently stopped when a security researcher registered a domain found in the malware's code. Once inside a system, WannaCry employed asymmetric encryption, using a combination of RSA and AES encryption algorithms to lock files, which made the decryption key unique and almost impossible to reproduce without paying the ransom. In 2018, the US brought charges against a North Korean agent of APT Lazarus, who was also previously blamed for the Sony hack in 2014. The extensive damage caused by WannaCry, with an estimated global cost in the billions, was particularly severe for organizations like the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), which suffered an estimated loss of US$100 million due to a large number of vulnerable machines. The discovery of a ""kill switch"" within the WannaCry code eventually stopped the 2017 outbreak from spreading further, although modified versions of the ransomware have since surfaced but failed to reach the same scale or notoriety as the original. On July 30 2020, the Council of the European Union santioned, within the framework of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Tollbox, the North Korean company Chosun Expo for the WannaCry attack",2017,5,1,,,,victim,[9],Disruption;

"North Korean State-Sponsored Hacking Group Lazarus Launched WannaCry Ransomware Attack Infecting Over 200,000 Computers in 150 Countries, Including Major Corporations and the UK National Health Service in May 2017","The WannaCry ransomware attack that broke out in May 2017 ranks as a major global ransomware incident. The attack affected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries and impacted companies such as FedEx, Honda, Nissan, and the UK National Health Service. WannaCry is a ransomware that targets Windows operating systems that have not been patched with a specific update offered by Microsoft since March 2017 and encrypts certain user files on the computer. Utilizing the EternalBlue exploit, the ransomware was able to spread rapidly by infecting other vulnerable systems on the same network. The ransomware initially set a ransom of 300 USD (in Bitcoin) and was later increased to 600 USD. Some victims only had a few days to respond to the ransomware demand - otherwise, they risked losing their data. The security authorities subsequently attributed the attack to the Lazarus Group, which is linked to North Korea, although some researchers dispute this attribution. The spread of the attack was inadvertently stopped when a security researcher registered a domain found in the malware's code. Once inside a system, WannaCry employed asymmetric encryption, using a combination of RSA and AES encryption algorithms to lock files, which made the decryption key unique and almost impossible to reproduce without paying the ransom. In 2018, the US brought charges against a North Korean agent of APT Lazarus, who was also previously blamed for the Sony hack in 2014. The extensive damage caused by WannaCry, with an estimated global cost in the billions, was particularly severe for organizations like the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), which suffered an estimated loss of US$100 million due to a large number of vulnerable machines. The discovery of a ""kill switch"" within the WannaCry code eventually stopped the 2017 outbreak from spreading further, although modified versions of the ransomware have since surfaced but failed to reach the same scale or notoriety as the original. On July 30 2020, the Council of the European Union santioned, within the framework of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Tollbox, the North Korean company Chosun Expo for the WannaCry attack",2017,5,1,,,,victim,[9],Disruption;

"North Korean State-Sponsored Hacking Group Lazarus Launched WannaCry Ransomware Attack Infecting Over 200,000 Computers in 150 Countries, Including Major Corporations and the UK National Health Service in May 2017","The WannaCry ransomware attack that broke out in May 2017 ranks as a major global ransomware incident. The attack affected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries and impacted companies such as FedEx, Honda, Nissan, and the UK National Health Service. WannaCry is a ransomware that targets Windows operating systems that have not been patched with a specific update offered by Microsoft since March 2017 and encrypts certain user files on the computer. Utilizing the EternalBlue exploit, the ransomware was able to spread rapidly by infecting other vulnerable systems on the same network. The ransomware initially set a ransom of 300 USD (in Bitcoin) and was later increased to 600 USD. Some victims only had a few days to respond to the ransomware demand - otherwise, they risked losing their data. The security authorities subsequently attributed the attack to the Lazarus Group, which is linked to North Korea, although some researchers dispute this attribution. The spread of the attack was inadvertently stopped when a security researcher registered a domain found in the malware's code. Once inside a system, WannaCry employed asymmetric encryption, using a combination of RSA and AES encryption algorithms to lock files, which made the decryption key unique and almost impossible to reproduce without paying the ransom. In 2018, the US brought charges against a North Korean agent of APT Lazarus, who was also previously blamed for the Sony hack in 2014. The extensive damage caused by WannaCry, with an estimated global cost in the billions, was particularly severe for organizations like the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), which suffered an estimated loss of US$100 million due to a large number of vulnerable machines. The discovery of a ""kill switch"" within the WannaCry code eventually stopped the 2017 outbreak from spreading further, although modified versions of the ransomware have since surfaced but failed to reach the same scale or notoriety as the original. On July 30 2020, the Council of the European Union santioned, within the framework of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Tollbox, the North Korean company Chosun Expo for the WannaCry attack",2017,5,1,,,,victim,[9],Disruption;

Cuba Ransomware Gang claims disruptive cyber attacks against Montenegro government servers in 2022,"In August 2022, the Montenegro government experienced an initial cyber attack, later confirming two series of attacks on government servers. The Cuba Ransomware Gang, identified by VX-Underground researchers, claimed responsibility through their leak site. The attack disrupted 150 workstations in 10 state institutions, including the Ministry of Finance, using the Zerodate virus. Stolen internal information, such as financial documents, correspondence, and source code related to the Montenegrin parliament, was reported to be leaked. Although the hackers demanded a $10 million ransom, officials deny receiving the demand. The attack targeted electricity and water supply systems, transportation services, and online government services. The National Security Agency (ANB) described it as unprecedented. As a precautionary measure, the state-owned power utility EPCG switched to manual operation. By September 1, 2022, the attack was still ongoing, causing government websites to be unavailable and leading to delays in court processes.
Deputy Prime Minister Konjevic believed there was sufficient evidence to link the attack to Russia, supported by the Montenegrin National Security Agency's briefing that mentioned ""several Russian services"" as the sponsors. The National Security Council decided to await further details from foreign partners to determine the responsible party. Anonymous ANB officials suspected Russian security services of targeting critical infrastructure, resulting in manual control of power plants. The US embassy in Montenegro issued a security alert, advising limited movement due to uncertain disruptions to public utilities, transportation, and telecommunication caused by the ongoing cyber attack. The US and France sent cyber experts to assist Montenegro based on its NATO membership and collective defense commitment.
