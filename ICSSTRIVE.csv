Several water monitors – which monitor irrigation systems and wastewater treatment systems – were left dysfunctional on Sunday after a cyber attack targeted the monitoring systems.  Specifically, water controllers for irrigating fields in the Jordan Valley were damaged, as were control systems for the Galil Sewage Corporation.

The management for both major systems was pushing all of Sunday morning to work through the issue and bring the systems back into full operation.  Farmers in the region were warned several days prior about suspicions over a planned cyber attack. Some of them, as a result of the warning, disconnected the remote control option for their irrigation systems and switched them to manual operation, instead, to prevent any harm from the attack. Indeed, those who left their systems on remote control were the ones impacted by the attack.

The attack is thought to be part of an annual “hacktivist” campaign that takes place every April, and this year’s attempt at least managed to cause a nuisance for some farms in the Jordan Valley.  The cyber attack is part of an annual campaign called “OpIsrael,” which strikes in April with DDoS attacks and breach attempts on targets in the country.

Each year of the cyber attack campaign seems to bring new targets of opportunity. This year the threat actors put a special focus on irrigation systems.

The unidentified hackers infiltrated a network used by the Technical Operations Group (TOG) to track fugitives, reports the Washington Post. The precise activities of the service are kept secret.

US Marshals Service spokesperson Drew Wade said no one in the witness protection program is in danger because of the breach.  Nevertheless, the official said, the incident is significant, affecting law enforcement sensitive information pertaining to the subjects of Marshals Service investigations.

The agency developed a workaround enabling the unit to continue operations and efforts to track down fugitives.  “Most critical tools” related to the affected computer network “were restored within 30 days of the breach discovery” in February, Wade told CNN, declining to explain what those critical tools were.  The network remains compromised nearly 3 months after being hit.

The Technical Operations Group (TOG) network provides surveillance capabilities to track fugitives.

At the same time as Entega, the lights also went out on the Stadtwerke Mainz website. Both companies are managed by their joint subsidiary, the IT service provider Count+Care. The malware got into the system because an employee had accidentally opened an email attachment.  Entega's website and e-mail server were paralyzed as a result. The systems of the Darmstädter Bauverein and the Frankfurt utility company FES were also affected by the attack on Count+Care, an Entega subsidiary.

To repair the damage, the hackers apparently demanded a ransom of 15 million euros. Entega let the ultimatum expire without paying, and much of the customer data was leaked on the dark web.  An Entega spokesman said the majority of customers could be affected, but to varying degrees. The investigation into the stolen data is still ongoing. According to Entega's annual report, the number of customer contracts at the end of 2021 was almost 700,000.

https://icsstrive.com/incident/irish-health-service-shut-down-amid-ransomware-attack/,"Ireland’s health service shut down its IT system after experiencing a “significant ransomware attack”.  The incident has affected more than 80% of IT infrastructure, with the loss of key patient information and diagnostics, resulting in severe impacts on the health service and the provision of care. All computer systems were switched off. Doctors, nurses and other workers lost access to systems for patient information, clinical care and laboratories. Emails went down, and staff had to turn to pen and paper.Lab test data had to be handwritten and manually entered - leading to greater risks of mistakes. Thousands of people's healthcare was disrupted. Confidential medical files were also stolen, with hackers threatening to release the data. A response was quickly mobilised internally, and the Irish Defence Forces were called in to help.

HSE commissioned PWC for independent report on the cyber attack: On 18 March, someone in the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) opened a spreadsheet that had been sent to them by email two days earlier. But the file was compromised with malware. The criminal gang behind the email spent the next two months working their way through the networks.  There were multiple warning signs that they were at work, but no investigation was launched, and that meant a crucial opportunity to intervene was missed, according to the report, and on May 14 the ransomware was released.     Senior staff set up a ""war room"", but the report criticises the lack of preparation or contingency planning for such a loss of systems.  ""The response teams could not initially focus on the highest priority response and recovery tasks due to the lack of preparedness for a widespread disruptive IT event,"" it says.

The attackers demanded payment to restore access to the computer systems,  Then on 20 May, the attackers, for reasons not entirely clear - but perhaps realizing the scale of what was happening - posted a link to a key that would decrypt files.

The cameras were installed on residential buildings in Kyiv and were initially used by residents to monitor the surrounding area and parking lot. After hacking them, the Russian intelligence services supposedly gained remote access to the cameras, changed their viewing angles, and connected them to YouTube to stream sensitive footage.

According to Ukraine’s security service, SBU, this footage likely helped Russians direct drones and missiles toward Kyiv during a large-scale missile strike against Ukraine on Tuesday. During the attack, Russia fired almost 100 drones and missiles, primarily targeting Kyiv and Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. At least 5 people were killed, and 129 were injured.
